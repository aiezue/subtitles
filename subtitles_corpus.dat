I die
for the Revolution.
No Chinese Woman has yet shed blood for the Revolution.
I shall be the first,
although the world doesn't know much about the Revolution.
I leave behind my husband and children.
My death
is my contribution to the Revolution.
It will build an indestructible home for all people,
a peaceful and calm world for all children.
The long-enslaved masses are numb,
they know not peace, nor calm.
These two children
will soon lose their mother.
I die for all children.
I die for the Revolution.
I'm not afraid, nor do I care about death.
I rejoice at my martyrdom:
At this moment
I cry with blissful tears.
Put the donation boxes in prominent spots.
Go over to the door.
Be vigilant.
Yes.
Let Mr. Sun rest.
Don't disturb him.
Yes.
Juemin.
Who's that?
Who?
Look.
What?
Go, quick.
Get up, there's a woman here.
Don't bother, just go.
Keqiang.
Time to get up.
Get up.
Let me sleep three more minutes.
Alright.
Get up.
Two minutes.
Fine.
Two minutes.
One minutes.
I'll get up.
I should go to Guangzhou for the uprising.
What?
You forgot the committee's decision last night?
Keqiang, listen.
I won't.
I must throw myself into battle.
Then last night's meeting was a waste.
Why can't we talk it through again?
There's nothing to discuss.
Huang Xing leads the Guangzhou uprising.
Sun Wen handles fundraising overseas.
We voted.
Promise.
Promise.
These are donations from abroad.
Overseas Chinese helped us.
I promised them.
I cannot fail them,
I must carry out my pledge.
It's not a personal promise
but Tongmenghui's promise.
They wrote these letters.
Who's this Woman?
Zonghan.
Xu Zonghan.
Tongmenghui member from my village.
I'm Huang Xing.
Zonghan coordinates underground organizations in Guangzhou.
You two pretend to be husband and wife.
It's a good cover.
No, it's not appropriate.
Why not?
I'm a woman and I don't care.
What are you afraid of?
It's easy to die in battle,
but hard to motivate the living.
You have the difficult task.
The Guangzhou uprising will finish off the Qing Dynasty.
Take this pocket watch.
On the day of the uprising,
we'll monitor time together.
Go,
Charge.
Quick.
Quick.
Destroy this wall.
Yes.
You rebel.
You dare revolt.
You revolutionary.
You dare revolt.
You...
You...
Where's Zhang Mingqi?
I don't know.
Quick.
And my Wife.
Quick.
Comrades taking part in the uprising
know me better.
It's easier for me to coordinate...
Nonsense.
I can wield my pen
and scalpel,
why not a gun?
Remember: You're still a wanted man by the Qing court,
you can't risk it.
If you return to China to lead the uprising,
you're being irresponsible.
Yu Peilun.
Yu Peilun.
Yu Peilun.
Here.
We couldn't Contact the other groups.
Zhang Mingqi ran away.
Keqiang said,
if the uprising fails,
you must inform Sun Wen immediately.
What else did he say?
He said,
if he's not back by dusk,
you must leave Guangzhou at once.
Quick.
Back off. All of you.
Listen to my command.
Attack from the sides.
- Yes. - Hand grenades.
- Yes. - Follow me.
Charge.
Charge.
Keqiang.
Your hand.
Keqiang.
Don't mind me, charge.
Yes.
Charge.
Get away.
Run.
- What are you doing? - Run.
Let me go.
Let me go.
Yu Peilun.
Gentlemen,
our fundraiser today
was originally organized for the Guangzhou uprising.
But just now,
I received news.
Fighting in Guangzhou has ceased.
The uprising has failed.
The telegram states,
the uprising failed,
many of our core members are dead.
You've never met them.
These young people who died were talented,
some came from rich families,
some have just gotten married.
They were willing to sacrifice themselves,
whatever the cost.
They sacrificed their lives for the cause
because they have faith.
What do your lies
have to do with us?
Good question.
Most of you gathered here
are overseas Chinese.
You know Well
our faces mark us as Chinese,
and we've suffered discrimination
and bullying.
We've endured unfair treatment.
All because the country of our people
has long been corrupt
and weak,
writhing in pain.
Our Chinese compatriots
face adversity,
our land taken by others.
Our Revolution
ensures people can pursue happiness,
that our race will regain dignity.
The Chinese revolutionary movement is blessed by support from overseas Chinese.
For many years,
I strongly believe this.
Overseas Chinese are the mother of the Revolution.
Gentlemen,
your children
have died for you.
Fang Shengdong.
Lin Shishuang.
Yu Peilun.
Chen Gengxin.
Lin Juemin.
This young man will soon be a father.
What's this?
US$300,000.00
Donation from Zhigongtang
I won't hide this from you.
We sold our ancestral house.
Yat-sen,
we're overseas Chinese,
our roots are in China.
The Qing Dynasty is no longer our home.
Without a place called home,
why Keep an ancestral house?
Take it.
If the Revolution fails,
you'll owe us for generations.
Another one.
Yat-sen,
your pocket Watch
can block bullets,
but not cannon shells.
Fire.
Empress Dowager,
I hear.
Sun Wen has long escaped abroad,
he hasn't returned for more than a decade.
We might want to arrest him,
but it's going to be hard.
Didn't we alert our envoys
and foreign governments
about Sun, telling them
they should monitor his movements?
But Sun gives public lectures everywhere,
raising funds, organizing rebels,
trafficking arms, plotting uprisings.
Minister Xu, perhaps you overstate.
He hasn't appeared before our eyes.
He's only mortal,
not the Monkey King.
What power can he wield?
Sun's done enough to rock the boat.
These years, unrest seethes everywhere,
rebellions follow one after another.
Sun's been misleading others with his lies,
so many follow his path.
What a troublemaker.
As if he doesn't make enough trouble.
The Qing Dynasty will not fall because of him.
If he dares enter the Forbidden City,
our Manchurian imperial army will kill him.
Yes,
let's just eradicate.
Sun Wen and his cohorts.
We'll destroy them once and for all.
Stop carrying on like this.
No matter whether to kill them,
or praise or punish them,
or whatever other solution,
I only have this to say:
Please, all of you,
let Us have some peace.
Recently,
the mortgage of our railways
against the Four Nations Bank loan
has led to riots.
What's the use of your rifles?
Tell them:
If they revolt,
they'll all die in vain.
Lin Juemin.
You're educated,
you come from a good family.
Why did you join the rebels?
Zhang Mingqi,
why do you hide in darkness?
What are you afraid of?
What am I afraid of?
You're afraid of my youth.
I have chosen death,
but I'm still young.
You might live,
but you are old and worthless.
Have you read the study of evolution?
Survival of the fittest.
Have you considered
the leading nations in the world
were all borne of revolution?
China must also have a revolution.
Affairs of the nation
are not your concern.
Sun Wen said,
China is Weak.
There's no way out.
The royal family, aristocrats and officials
all follow their old ways,
but what of the people?
They barely survive, ignorant of the world.
China is no match for other countries,
it's a dire situation.
Young man,
the Qing court has a hard time too.
The court?
The court gave Hong Kong to England
and Taiwan to Japan.
That's the good Work of the Qing court.
What's the use of keeping it?
I'm interrogating you,
yet you turn around to question me?
You have no grounds to sentence me.
Lin Juemin,
I had wanted to exercise clemency.
There's no need.
My comrades and I fought together,
we'll die together.
I can't be an exception.
When you die,
you'll be left with nothing.
The Qing court wants my life;
I'll destroy the dynasty at its heart.
Hello, Your Royal Highness,
this is a car used by British royalty.
As a member of Chinese royalty, let me try.
Please.
You've come because of the Sichuan railways?
The loan agreements between our countries
and the mortgage of your railways cannot be written off.
That's the trouble.
I knew it.
The mortgage of the Sichuan and Guangdong railways
against your loan
will lead to trouble down the road.
If you forcibly take the railways,
it'll be a catastrophe.
Can't we find a solution, my dear lord?
Look at this invention.
It's an iron machine.
It can move forward and backward,
left and right,
whatever you wish.
My lord,
please enjoy this humble gift
and steer it in the right direction.
Mr. Ambassador,
we've already sent troops from Wuchang
to suppress the Sichuan riots.
Don't you worry.
Your Royal Highness, you're a great strategist.
You're the one holding the steering wheel.
You have money,
you have navel fleets,
you've always been better businessmen than us.
In 50 years,
the car you gave me
will be scrap metal,
but my little gift to you
will be priceless.
Thank you.
Open the door. Huang Keqiang.
Quick, open the door. Huang Keqiang
I Know you're inside..
Open,
Huang Keqiang.
Huang Keqiang,
open the door.
Open the door for me.
What are you doing?
Put it down.
Give me the blade.
Let me go.
What are you doing?
What?
You can't die.
I know you saw
all of them being killed.
I know
we failed.
I didn't want to die, Zonghan
I want to keep this hand
to wield the gun.
Help me,
chop it off.
No.
- No. - So we failed,
we've failed before.
No.
Children,
do you know what the telegram says?
No.
Huang Keqiang is alive.
Fate has been kind.
Who's he?
Huang Keqiang
is a strong and determined man,
a man who won't die.
We don't know him.
But do you know Homer Lea?
Yes.
Take me to him, please.
Yes.
Where's Homer Lea?
There.
Homer Lea.
Homer.
Homer.
- Homer. - Hey, I'm here.
Mr. Lea,
tell me.
Why are you so interested in Chinese revolution?
Nowadays,
a Chinese revolution
is the only thing that can make exciting history.
Exciting?
That's not what our revolution is about.
Why revolution?
I was once a doctor.
I used to save a lot of lives
with my scalpel.
But sadly,
in my country,
life is so miserable
it might be Worse than death.
I always wonder
why my compatriots
have to endure their lives with no dignity.
They survive like animals
with very basic needs,
suffering the oppression from the ruling class
and foreign powers.
Now,
I cannot accept it,
I will not accept it.
I want to change.
I want a revolution.
Come,
I'll show you.
Recently, in Sichuan,
the central part of China, people have launched a movement
of protecting railway projects against the hopelessly corrupt Qing government.
It is said that the Qing government has to mobilize the army from Hubei province o Sichuan.
What they don't know is many officers who stayed behind in the army of.
Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangsu,
are active members of Tongmenghui, the Restoration League,
I have a feeling
that in the south of Yangtze River,
an even bigger movement
will take hold.
I want to join your revolution.
That's fine.
I would like to invite you
to join the Chinese Revolution as a military advisor,
but I'm afraid I cannot afford you and pay the attention that you deserve.
This,
this is not about money.
It's about you, Sun.
You must be China's revolutionary leader.
I promise you.
Peng Chufan.
Liu Fuji. Yang Hongsheng.
The three of them plotted mutiny.
Now punishment is upon them.
We execute them today
as a Warning to all.
Among you...
Governor,
we found the list. What should we do?
What else can we do with
those rebels from the Gongjinhui?
Starting tonight,
kill everyone on the list.
No one will be spared.
All of you,
ask your own conscience.
The Qing court supports
and protects you,
yet you plot to rebel,
following such thugs as Sun Wen.
Isn't that the behavior of unfilial sons,
killing their parents?
Stop, you two.
What are your names?
Xiong Bingkun of the 8th regiment, 8th engineering battalion.
Jin Zheolong of the 8th regiment, 8th engineering battalion.
Lie low.
This is a crisis.
Don't be hot-tempered.
Yes.
What is this?
A mutiny?
Not sleeping?
What do you want?
What?
This is a mutiny.
Tao Qisheng.
Brother,
put down your rifle.
I'm leading a mutiny.
How many more will you kill?
You're lucky that
I'm aiming at you.
Brother,
this is not a joke.
If we don't do it now, then when?
Help.
Tell Zhang Zhenwu to bring two of his battalions.
Aim all artillery at the Governor's mansion.
When Xiong Bingkun lights the torch,
fire at the mansion.
Yes.
Charge.
Hand grenades.
Go.
Jin Zhaolong
Jin Zhaolong, Xiong Bingkun.
Lead two platoons.
Order everyone to bring gas canisters.
Rush in to fuel the fire.
Light the target.
Yes.
- Quick. - Quick.
Quick.
Quick.
Ready,
aiming at the Governor's mansion.
Load.
Done.
Fire.
Load.
Fire.
Good morning, Mrs. Johnson.
Good morning.
Here.
Oh, yes.
Oh, Dr. Sun.
Yes?
It seems like there's something in today's paper about China.
Thank you.
Do you need some help, Dr. Sun?
Can I give you some water?
I'm all right.
Yat-sen.
Hey, what's going on in here?
What are you guys doing?
Come on.
Yat-sen. The Revolution has succeeded.
- Hey, what's the matter with you? - Sorry.
On October 10,
The Revolutionary army took over Wuchang.
Governor Rui Cheng fled overnight.
Wuchang revolutionaries telegraphed the entire country,
asking them to join in the rebellion. The world's in shock.
Yat-sen,
you should return to China immediately.
I'll reserve a boat ticket for you.
You only need to spend 20 days across the Pacific, then you'll reach Shanghai.
It happened in Wuchang.
It happened in Wuchang.
Send a telegram to Keqiang in Hong Kong,
so he travels to Wuchang to lead the revolution.
Yes.
Sun,
I'm ready.
I'll go to China with you.
No.
I'm going to Europe first.
Huang Xing is much better than me to handle this in China.
Why?
The unrest in China
will be closely linked to the Four Nations Bank loan to the Qing court.
The court's out of money now,
but if they get the loan,
they can thwart the revolution.
Reserve tickets for Europe.
Zonghan,
don't bother making dinner.
We're running out of time.
Put it down.
Why are you so anxious?
You don't need it.
The battle in Wuchang will be intense.
I'm concerned for your safety.
What about your own safety?
Don't Worry,
I won't die.
Fate will be kind to me.
I should go now.
Go.
What happened?
Only yesterday Rui Cheng reported to us
that the rebel leaders were killed.
A day passed and...
The New Army had it easy.
Clearly,
the Wuchang regiments were sent to Sichuan to stop the unrest,
so the city was unguarded...
Tell me something I don't already know.
The Qing court has ruled for more than 200 years. We've ridden through many storms.
It's only a small flame, we'll extinguish it.
Who should we send
to extinguish this flame?
Empress Dowager,
I humbly believe...
I recommend Yin Chang, head of the Imperial Army.
This is his duty.
Xu Shichang.
Yes.
Just now,
what were you saying?
Yuan Shikai can fulfill this task.
Better to appoint Yin Chang.
This is family affair.
It's better to send over a Manchu.
Yes.
Empress Dowager,
I would like to submit a request.
Say it, Royal Prince.
Food and supplies precede an army.
There's this old saying...
Be precise,
- don't just quote the classics. - In my opinion,
We should finalize the loan
from the Four Nations Bank,
we'll have less to worry about later.
Haven't we discussed this for months?
Why hasn't this been done?
The Four Nations Bank felt
we've been indecisive
about mortgaging our railways.
There's been criticism outside.
People say that
we're giving away our sovereignty.
If we're not rulers here,
is this even a country?
General Li,
for the sake of the times, please decide.
I've treated you well.
Why are you making it so difficult for me?
We ask that you lead the Military Government.
We're not making it difficult.
Drop your gun.
Please ask him to drop his gun.
Put it down.
General Li,
you've treated us well.
We wish you'd lead the Military Government.
You nave great talents among the revolutionary ranks.
Why don't you ask Sun Wen to be your leader?
Li Yuanhong.
The revolutionary party will select our leaders.
At present.
Sun Wen is still abroad,
and Huang Keqiang is on his Way here.
That's why we offer you this.
Li Yuanhong,
do you understand your predicament?
I can give up my position in the Qing court,
but I don't want to become a revolutionary official.
I only want to return home.
You have no idea of the real situation:
Although Rui Cheng and Zhang Biao have gone into hiding,
if the court's troops were to counterattack,
they can destroy Wuchang in a second.
Come back.
Stop.
- Come back. - Go.
Stop.
Go.
Lie down.
Yin Chang's firing at us from a German battleship.
General Li,
are you all right?
What damned battle is this?
I'll die because of you.
Remove the ammunition, quick.
We'll die together.
We'll count you as a revolutionary martyr.
Li Yuanhong, General of the Mixed Brigade.
I'm Military Governor Li Yuanhong.
If you Want to live,
return to your stations.
Attention.
Yes.
Target: Battleship "Chuyu"

Cease fire.
Why did we stop?
I'm the Military Governor,
I make all the decisions.
Why did they stop?
They ran out of ammunition?
Doesn't look like it.
Should we fire back to test them?
What for?
Better keep our lives. Run.
Run.
Even if we annihilate Yin Chang,
so what?
He's of no consequence.
The real battle is ahead of us.
Yes.
You want to cut my queue?
Fine.
Come.
Since you revolutionaries have bestowed such honour on me,
I'll be presumptuous and break the law.
Father.
Good news.
You scared away my fish.
You're coming out of seclusion.
You can't hold your horses, can you?
General, Huafu is here.
Huafu.
Let's show
the revolutionaries and those in the Forbidden City
our great Beiyang Army
and our great power.
Yes.
Attention, artillery.
Target ahead,
25° to the right,
distance at 500.
Load.
Ready.
Fire.

Keqiang.
Where should We go?
Wherever there's heavy gunfire.
Make way.
Make way.
Commander.
Avoid gunfire.
Avoid gunfire.
Hide in the trench with your squad.
Hide in the trench.
Hide in the trench.
Don't run.
Don't run.
Go back.
Don't run.
Retrieve the gun.
Remember,
alive soldier is useless
without his weapon.
Tell me, Huafu.
Tell me.
General,
We've taken.
Hankou.
Your order to Scorch
we attack Wuchang right away.
Now gives us access to Wu...
What's your next step?
Morale is high,
we attack Wuchang right away.
Great.
We take Hankou first,
then attack Beijing.
We'll conquer the world.
Sit down, have some food.
This is a Heaven-sent opportunity.
Sit down.
Keding,
you're cutting to the quick.
Let's wait on.
Wuchang.
After the rabbit is killed,
the hunting dog will be cooked.
Enemy positions nave advanced.
Once they cover their firing range,
the infantry will attack.
The key to combat is to avoid gunfire.
Yes.
Idiot,
trying to run away? I'll kill you.
Drop your gun.
He's Huang Xing, our Commander.
Salute.
I command you all:
From now on,
follow my orders.
Yes.
Always be prepared to enter the frontlines.
Yes.
We torched Hankou well,
it was a great offense.
But now,
we won't follow up.
If the revolutionaries can be easily defeated,
the country still belongs to the Qing court.
If the Qing court is also weak,
the revolutionaries could seize power.
Somehow,
we must be get a share of it.
Here's my condition:
I take full power over the army and its supplies.
Now.
Empress Dowager Longyu and the princes must Know that
they either get the loan from the Four Nations Bank,
or there'll be no more battle.
Regarding the revolutionaries...
Should we Contact Li Yuanhong and test the waters?
He's not a revolutionary.
In the long run,
we should find someone we can connect with.
Sun Yat-sen and Huang Xing.
Reporting to the General.
Wang Jingwei is here.
Please.
Isn't Wang
supposed to be in Beijing, in prison?
Zaifeng released him.
You were locked up for a year.
You've suffered.
Times have changed, don't mention it any more.
I treasure you most among the revolutionaries.
I was just telling Keding,
we should swear as blood brothers.
Zhaoming,
tell me.
What do the revolutionaries want?
We Want to establish a republic.
Republic?
But Why?
Feudalism has kept China
back for far too long.
As long as there's an Emperor,
we cannot rid ourselves of the old system.
The Revolution must
depose the Emperor
and the imperial system.
That's all theory.
We have to put it in practice.
When the Republic is established,
who will lead it?
A leader of the Republic is elected by all citizens.
Zhaoming.
The General pondered seriously
before inviting you from Beijing.
He'd like your help.
You're the one who knows
the revolutionaries well.
Zhaoming
ls Sun Wen still abroad?
Gentlemen.
Gentlemen,
you know who I am
and Why I'm here.
It seems to me
that you have decided that you're against the revolution.
Am I right?
Go.
If that's the case,
the Qing government will take this loan,
buy guns and shoot through
the hearts of revolutionaries.
Your money will support the corrupt Qing government,
in exchange for What?
Railway?
Our railway.
Sir.
Sir,
please keep your voice down.
You're deciding the future of my country here.
Being a Chinese,
I have the right to know what's going on here.
We've already informed your government
regarding our decision.
You must tell me your decision.
Let me remind you that we're in Europe.
You really should behave like a gentleman.
Do you understand what's happening in China now?
Mr. Sun Wen.
He won't answer.
They are bankers,
they only care about their money,
not other people's fate.
Mr. Hillier,
do you know who he is?
No.
He's the man who will decide the future of China.
Who are you?
Tang Manrou.
Idiot.
Your father is the Chinese Imperial Ambassador,
and you spoke for Sun Wen?
Do you know who he is?
Who is he?
He's a traitor of the Qing Dynasty.
He's a wanted criminal.
He's a revolutionary.
Don't you know?
Tang Manrou.
I know who he is,
that's why I helped him.
Mr. Hillier.
Hillier.
I must go before this person arrives.
We cannot be present in the same place.
Why leave, Minister Tang?
I beg you, you still haven't done us
the honour of accepting our invitation.
You really mustn't leave.
Please. Don't leave.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I'm well aware that I've come here uninvited.
However,
as the leader of the Chinese revolution, I only ask you,
please reconsider the 6 million pounds,
your loan to the Qing government.
Sun Wen,
you're a subject of the Qing Dynasty,
yet you show no respect for your country.
How can you claim any respect regarding our country?
You've lost it all a long time ago.
I represent the Whole Chinese people,
and speak in the name as leader of the Chinese revolution.
Dr. Sun,
we will not break
such an important business contract.
Mr. Thompson,
this is not a business contract,
it's a political deal.
If this contract is signed, what's at stake here
is Chinese sovereignty.
Mr. Sun,
our German banks only care about business,
we don't care about domestic politics.
My dearest German delegates,
every time the Qing government fires a gun at us,
your money presses the trigger.
The Qing government will buy weapons with your loan, nothing else.
Perhaps you've misunderstood.
According to my understanding, this loan is intended to help rebuild the railways.
Mr. Sun,
our minister in Peking,
Sir John Newell Jordan,
said the same thing about the loan.
Dear Sir Buchanan,
I believe when Mr. Jordan realizes
that the money is used to destroy the Chinese revolution,
he will change his mind.
Sun Wen.
This is my second warning.
Do not defame the Qing Dynasty here.
Defame?
Minister Tang,
how you underestimated us.
We Want to depose you and the court.
Gentlemen,
we all know that to give good money
to a bad client
is a fatal mistake.
The Qing government is like a patient diagnosed with cancer.
Your loan is like sugar pills,
it'll only make him feel better,
but the fate is sealed.
It seems that you are quite pessimistic about the future in China.
No, I'm not.
On the contrary,
my vision of the new China
is very positive.
I see huge miles covered with natural resources.
I see thousands of banks providing new capital.
I see a mountain of railways connecting all the modern communities.
Gentlemen,
you are bankers,
you should know to invest your money wisely.
Would you rather invest your money
into a dying government or the emerging one?
Mr. Sun Yat-sen,
I know you are the leader of this revolution,
and I respect your revolution.
However, we cannot invest money against the interests of our own nation.
You may know that
I'm a surgeon.
As a doctor, my duty
is to save my patient's life.
One day
I found my country
is suffering cancer.
Mr. Hillier,
The situation of China
is like this roast lamb,
it's unlikely our people
would enjoy freedom,
equality
and fraternity.
Yes,
that is to say,
this is China.
And all of you Want a piece.
Germany
here's your piece,
the Shandong peninsula.
Good location, isn't it?
What's all this?
Sir Buchanan,
your piece,
left rather small on this plate:
Only Hong Kong,
and you know very well,
this is a gate
to reach China.
Mr. Thompson, let me out out a special piece for you,
in memory of all those Chinese lives
that were lost carving out your mountain for the transcontinental railway
where they sleep, buried, the bones of Chinese labourers.
It's a pity,
all those countries not here today:
Russia,
Japan and Portugal.
They want Pescadores, Liaodong Peninsula
and Macau.
Gentlemen,
this
is the last time you can gather to feast on China.
I really hope
I made my point clear.
Mr. Tang,
please wait a moment. Please.
Go home.
Please.
Please stay.
Stay.
Here it is.
Please tell me, what does Revolution mean?
Like a doctor who heals patients,
a revolution saves an entire people.
Mr. Sun,
I heard girls in China
have to bound their feet from young age.
Is it painful?
Yes, it's painful
but
it will be gone very soon.
I see. Thank you.
Must people
lose their lives in revolution?
The final goal of revolution isn't death,
but to change fate.
Young people sacrificed themselves for the revolution,
so those living can lead better lives.
Extend firing range.
Come.
It's overheated. It won't fire.
Go, piss.
Lie down.
Lie down.
Nurse.
Little Hubei,
gather hand grenades.
Give them to me.
- Give them to me. - No.
Let go.
- Commander. - Let go.
Don't pull me back.
Don't pull me back.
Let go.
Let go.
Go.
Little Hubei.
Ammunition handler.
Charge.
General,
Huafu is here.
General,
We've taken Hanyang.
Should we continue fighting?
There's
no need to be in such a rush.
We nave to let the Qing court understand,
if they don't pay up,
we won't move.
Your words mean...
Can't you read?
Read it yourself.
Fight slowly,
wait and see?
- But morale is high. - I must return to Beijing
and see what the Empress Dowager says.
Let me tell you my bottom line:
If the court
doesn't give me enough money,
I won't fight.
I'd thought it'd be easy to defeat them,
but Sun's rebels
are resilient.
I also lack ammunition and supplies.
Empress Dowager,
I was forced to cease
the battle of Wuchang.
Yuan Shikai.
Yes, Empress Dowager.
How much do you need?
Tell me.
If I have12 million taels of gold,
I can finish off the revolutionaries
within a few months.
If we have no money for battle,
we only have one choice:
To make peace with the revolutionaries.
You dare?
Making peace means we acknowledge them.
The Beiyang Army is on its
last round of ammunition.
I'll never agree to
your making peace.
If you really care about the Qing court,
do something useful, donate your riches.
Why don't you donate your own money to the cause?
Yuan Shikai.
Empress Dowager,
as I had reported earlier,
we must have enough money to support the army.
Yuan Shikai is indeed hard pressed.
You love to argue
all the time,
pretending to be loyal ministers.
Now
in times of crisis,
you've all become selfish.
The dynasty is destined to fall.
Your servant
will give up all of his possessions.
This is a time of crisis, I will lead
my entire family to protect the country.
Your servant
doesn't want a coffin,
nor does he care about his ancestral grave.
If money can help destroy the rebels,
then
I'll leave everything and
return to my home village.
The Four Nations Bank has been persuaded by Sun,
I'm afraid we won't receive
a cent of this loan.
I know.
Heaven will punish.
Sun Wen for this.
Empress Dowager,
even though we run out of money, food,
and ammunition,
we still have for centuries
our loyal subjects.
I only have this to say:
I will die for the Qing Dynasty.
Sun Wen, your interference...
with the Four Nations Bank loan
has generated controversy in China.
This is the Prince Regents order to assassinate you.
This one
looks more like
a portrait of the deceased.
I don't agree with you,
but I respect your courage.
I won't Kill you.
I want to persuade you.
Sun Wen, we are both past middle age.
Confucius said,
At 50, I knew my destiny.
He also said,
At 40, I am not deluded.
I've never wavered
from my beliefs.
I know Why you won't Kill me.
You're a father,
you know
the Qing court you serve
will eventually destroy your children.
We all want a strong and bright China
for our children.
Go,
I don't want to see you again.
Mr. Jordan,
you're the first guest in my new house.
Now that you've moved to Beijing,
we can see each other more often.
Yes.
I don't intend to leave the city this time.
How's the situation in the South?
Difficult.
Sun Wen and Huang Xing are southern barbarians with big appetites.
You could have conquered Wuchang,
but you stopped.
We all knew
the Qing Dynasty has run out of money,
the end is near.
You want to profit from the power balance
between the Qing court and the revolutionary army.
So now you want peace.
What do you think
of this balance between my left and right hands?
Truth be told, I'm very impressed.
But the revolutionaries won't talk to me.
Now I understand. Would you like us to extend a hand?
You...
We'll pave the way for you to negotiate peace with the revolutionaries.
It's not good for anyone if fighting continues.
What's most important now is holding onto power.
Real power.
I'm looking for a collaborator
to protect the interests of Britain in China.
Well, you've found him.
Military Governor, let me explain.
I sent Keqiang to Shanghai
because of the overall strategy of the revolutionary movement.
I don't understand.
The Wuchang uprising attracted
the world's attention.
Isn't that also part of the overall strategy?
Since we can attack Nanjing, why can't we defend Wuchang'?
In Wuchang,
we're in a stalemate with the Beiyang Army.
Our trainee soliders have suffered heavy casualties.
In Nanjing,
the enemy is weak.
Our plan is to attack Nanjing, than retake Wuchang.
'That's our overall strategy.
This is the decision made by the Tongmenghui.
I must abide by it.
Fine. Whatever you say.
But I won't go to Shanghai.
Please understand,
it hasn't been easy to forge our paths together.
My home is here.
My power base is here.
Military Governor Li,
it appears we won't be sharing
the same path.
My child, don't move.
Don't move.
Lie down.
Listen,
if you want to live,
we must amputate your leg.
Can you hear me?
Alcohol.
It's fine.
Ready?
- Be brave. - We begin now.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Stop.
Stop.
Come.
Take him away.
You've said it before.
So we failed.
Haven't we failed before?
I'm talking to you.
Idiot.
Mr. Sun,
telegram from England for you.
Okay,
here you are.
Thank you.
Mr. Sun,
I must inform you right away.
The Four Nations Bank decided to hold off
on the loan to the Qing government.
You once told me that.
Revolution is life,
not only living,
but fate.
I don't understand Revolution,
but I've struggled and fought, I was angry.
I also knew,
I'd end up as sacrifice
along with my father.
I wish your Revolution,
I'1O,
wish our Revolution,
every SUCCESS.
Yat-sen.
Yat-sen.
Keqiang.
Where are you?
Keqiang
I'm here.
Can you hear me?
I can.
Where are you?
Huang Keqiang.
Yat-sen.
I'm starboard.
Me too.
Keqiang.
At the Welcome ceremony,
you have to put on
the revolutionary army uniform.
Yes.
Yat-sen.
Binglin, you're all here.
Not in first class?
- No. - Second class?
No.
Yat-sen.
It saved my life once.
Keqiang,
your hand.
Guangzhou uprising.
Doesn't matter.
Yat-sen.
Mr. Sun.
Dunchu.
You're here.
Yat-sen, we searched all the way to the beam.
You're all here.
A hug.
Let's go.
Yat-sen, we waited so long for your return.
Shiping, you haven't aged a bit.
Mr. Sun,
after your ship departed from Europe,
on your journey back,
what thoughts came over you?
After 16 years of tribulations,
I've returned to my motherland.
Mr. Sun,
we hear you've returned with huge donations,
ls that true?
I don't have any money.
All I bring is the Revolutionary spirit.
What is the ultimate goal of the Revolution?
The goals of the Revolution are simple:
We overthrow imperial rule
and save our people.
Mr. Sun,
what did you tell
those bankers in Europe?
I told them,
it's the Chinese people
who'll steer the fate of China,
not foreigners
or Manchu royalty.
Mr. Sun, the north and south are now negotiating peace.
What is your opinion?
My opinion is this:
We haven't reached our Revolutionary goal, we won't negotiate.
Tie up them.
Our position is that
unless the Emperor abdicates,
there'll be no peace agreement.
Our position is that
the monarchical system cannot change.
This is a family dinner. Shaochuan,
you're part of the family.
Come, try this.
A specialty from home.
Lotus root with glutinous rice.
Come, sit.
General,
this is.
To thank you.
You put in so much effort in the negotiations.
You've worked so hard.
Please tell me
what's on your mind.
You're the only one among Us
who knew Sun Wen.
I want to know more about.
Sun Wen.
What type of a man is he?
Zhang Shizhao said,
China will rise because of Sun,
he's the person
who'll revive the country.
Miyazaki considers Sun
a hero who will save China.
Kang Youwei claimed Sun is illiterate.
Wu Zhihui says that Sun is a hardworking scholar.
Some say he's like Robin Hood,
an outlaw.
Some say he's a real scholar,
an itinerant doctor holding a scalpel.
Others call him
a good-for-nothing liar.
There are many versions.
Shaochuan,
he has so many followers.
How does he do it?
I did hear this from many people:
That Sun
is selfless.
A selfless person?
Where in the world can We find one?
It's been 2000 years,
we can't wait any longer for.
- China's first Republic. - Representatives from
the 17 provinces have decided
not to elect a President, but to elect a Grand Marshal.
Mr. Sun, please sign.
A Grand Marshal cannot be head of state.
We must elect a President.
On the Presidential election,
should we wait to hear from Yuan Shikai?
If he can really hasten the Emperor's abdication...
The negotiating parties already made a pact.
Whoever first deposes the Qing government will become President.
Yuan Shikai hasn't deposed the Qing court.
We didn't break our promise.
It you insist on a Presidential election,
people will use that as an excuse to resume fighting.
So what?
We fought and look what we've achieved today.
Keqiang.
If we resume fighting, what are our chances of winning?
We have no money,
morale is low,
we have no sure chance of winning.
How can we fight?
This is impractical.
When the revolutionary army had nothing,
we were willing to sacrifice our lives.
Now we have half a country,
what are We afraid of?
The international community nee expressed support for Yuan Shikai.
Overseas Chinese all hope that we could setup e government as soon as possible
and elect a President.
To be safe,
I think we should wait.
If Yuan doesn't depose the Emperor for another 100 years,
do we still wait?
Let's put pressure on him, now.
If Yuan makes the Emperor abdicate,
do we have to keep our promise?
Even if Yuan makes the Emperor abdicate,
he isn't qualified to be President.
Not true.
If Yuan keeps his promise,
he can become President.
If you've promised him anyway, why bother holding an election?
Good question.
It's Worth it.
First,
we have to establish
the concept of a Republic.
It's just like building a road
in the wilderness,
so the Revolution can continue its path.
In future, in China,
no one can turn back.
Lie down.
Against the wall.
All of you.
Against the wall.
Against the wall.
He's the assassin.
Release him.
Who sent you here?
Sun Wen is a sinner,
he's corrupt,
he's sullied the Qing dynasty,
he's immoral,
he misleads the people,
he's beyond pardon.
Everyone can kill him.
It's no use interrogating him.
We live in entirely different worlds.
Yes.
Two days ago,
on December 27,
provincial representatives voted
and approved
the Provisional Government Organizational Draft.
They also approved the Presidential system
as well as
the nomination of candidates.
Elections will take place
today, December 29,
for the position of.
Provisional President.
I declare
each of the 17 provinces,
though some with more representatives than others,
is only given one vote.
A candidate receiving more the two-thirds of the votes
will become Provisional President.
Those in favor, raise their hands.
This is the Presidential ballot.
Your decision is crucial.
We hope you will not disappoint your people
in your choice.
Please fill in your ballot.
Homer.
Sun.
What are you doing here?
The Presidential election is ongoing in the conference hall.
I'm one of the candidates.
History,
you're making history.
I'm witnessing history.
I'm standing right beside history.
For thousands of years,
in Chinese history, we the people
never received the opportunity to
elect the head of government.
Never.
That
is what we've been fighting for.
Our people have been fighting ongoing for so long.
And now we've finally done it.
Homer,
when did you get here?
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
Now, as head of the Assembly...
I must be there.
I declare the results.
Out of a total of 17 votes,
Sun Wen received 16.
The Provisional President of the Republic of China is.
Sun Wen.
Dr. Sun,
I heard your name.
I told you,
you'd be China's first President.
Tang Shaoyi,
didn't you say he's selfless?
What an slap in the face.
General.
Go.
Order.
Feng Guozhang and Duan Qirui
to issue a joint telegram against the Republic.
Tang Shaoyi is sympathetic to the Republic, unable to fulfill his duties,
he's dismissed as representative to the negotiations.
Yes.
Send a telegram to Wu Tingfang:
I recognize neither the Nanjing Provisional Government
nor its so-called President Sun Wen.
Yat-sen,
we just heard.
Zhang Xun has amassed
his troops around Suzhou.
Also,
some Qing soldiers have been sighted
near Qinhuai River this afternoon.
Mr. President,
we advise
delaying the inauguration ceremony.
Yes, better to be cautious.
Today is New Year's Day of 1912,
everything is renewed.
The Provisional President of the Republic of China
must be sworn in today.
Fine.
I'll take care of all security details
for the Provisional President.
Photo session.
Please, look here, here.
I pledge to overthrow the Qing dynasty,
strengthen the Republic of China,
foster better livelihoods for all.
These I promise to the people.
I will follow them.
I will serve the country with faith.
I will serve all people.
Until the hegemony of the Qing dynasty is overthrown,
and the country has no strife,
when China will stand tall in the World,
recognized among nations.
At that time,
I will resign from the position of Provisional President.
This is my pledge to all citizens of China.
Just now,
I pledged myself as the Provisional President.
Now,
I have a few words to add.
Today,
the Republic of China is established,
but the feudal court still stands.
Unless feudalism is uprooted,
our Revolution isn't complete.
I await
the day
I'll relinquish my position
to the person
who carries through the abdication of the Qing Emperor.
What's going on?
I'd said it before, we shouldn't rush to elect a President.
The Beiyang Army has been mobilized, war will erupt very soon.
I hear Yuan Shikai has even engaged assassins.
Who's afraid of assassins?
Mr. Sun,
may I suggest,
in view of the situation,
please ponder this seriously.
If Yuan Shikai doesn't depose the Qing court,
President Sun will not step down.
Does Mr. Sun want to indulge in the position of President?
Wang Zhaoming,
Sun Wen isn't that type.
Since he's so selfless,
what's the harm of my asking?
It's all about trust,
belief,
and faith
without any doubt.
I'm only afraid of
an all-out battle between North and South.
Who'd be responsible for that?
If our Revolution is stolen by someone else,
who'd be responsible for that?
Huang Keqiang, you...
Zhaoming.
Stop arguing, please.
I protect you in front of everyone,
but we must be frank behind closed doors.
You don't have to close any doors.
Just say it, Keqiang.
We cannot accede to any of Yuan Shikai's demands.
But he has the power.
He can quickly depose the Qing court.
To establish our Republic
we need not only battles but also politics.
This is Revolution,
not giving a crown to someone else.
Sun Wen,
the Revolution doesn't belong to any single person.
Keqiang,
what do you mean?
You don't understand.
Idon%?
You're accusing me of not understanding politics.
But I know Yuan Sl'1il<ai.
Keqiang.
You've never seen
how he killed young men.
I'm Worried.
He might become an enemy of the Republic.
He might
even restore autocratic rule.
It's my ninth wife's birthday.
Westerners celebrate birthdays with cakes.
But we don't.
We eat peaches.
Look how festive they ere.
It hurts.
Please let go.
It hurts.
Where's Weiting?
I need to talk to him.
What happened?
Weiting,
let's step aside.
What are you afraid of?
So what if I want to revolt?
So what?
It's high time
we race against Sun Wen.
Look, they haven't been idle:
Electing President,
setting up government.
The best peaches on the tree
are picked clean by others.
I'll kill you.
You're a madman.
Stop him. Stop him.
Sputtering madness.
Help.
Please stop him.
Stop him.
Weiting.
Calm down.
Why did you hit him so hard?
At this moment,
I can't afford even one mistake.
You're right.
It's simple.
I'm sitting on a bed of nails.
If I don't force the court,
the situation is dire:
The Revolutionaries control half the country,
I can't oppose them much longer.
But if the Emperor abdicates because of me,
I'll be blamed for generations to come.
This is indeed
a tricky situation.
The crux of the matter is,
I want to become President.
When I arrived,
I was resentful.
But now that I've seen you,
I'm no longer angry.
Now,
our baby is inside me.
Keqiang,
this painting will soon be finished.
But I can't decide
where to hang it.
I want to propose.
Wu Tingfang to issue a public statement.
If the Emperor doesn't abdicate,
the ceasefire will end.
Whoever tarries,
whoever resists,
will be punished by all.
If the truce cannot be maintained,
we'll declare war again.
If we resume war,
I'll lead the troops to the North.
Keqiang.
You were right.
I've thought long and hard.
We have to establish provisional laws.
It's unimportant who serves a single term.
We must establish
a system
to restrain not only Yuan Shikai
but
anyone who ever dreams of becoming an emperor.
Painter,
please use bright red for the flag with 18 stars.
Yes.
Comradres, I hear you are
disputing my resignation,
but it takes more than a day
of feudal hegemony.
I do hope you will not just focus on
one official title,
but create a truly relevant,
legally protected revolutionary system.
The vvol'ldisirT1h'1ehse. Those who follow the righteous path thrive,
those who do not become extinct.
I hold fast to the Revolution,
knowing it will bear fruit.
After such a long journey,
we will reach our revolutionary goal.
What does Sun Wen want?
What telegram?
What declaration? What war?
Mr. Jordan is right.
It is most important to hold onto power.
The President's chair isn't comfortable.
Even if it's full of pins,
I still Want to sit on it.
The British Ambassador told me:
That winter, like today,
the winds were chilly,
it was snowing.
It was around Spring Festival,
but the entire city was desolate,
the atmosphere almost tragic.
The guillotine was placed
in the middle of the public square,
icicles of blood
still hanging on the blade.
Louis XVI
was bound and taken there.
He was cold, without even a coat.
He was shivering.
Everyone brought their family
to witness this great occasion.
When the hour came,
the executioner put the King's head on the block,
the blade was released,
there was ice on his face.
Listen...
Go on, Yuan Shikai.
Go on.
Listen.
The whoosh of the blade.
The whoosh of the blade. Then?
Go on, Yuan Shikai.
Then, the end.
The end?
That quick?
Yuan Shikai,
you're kidding.
You're making this up.
You've made up this story from the West for me.
I reappointed you against my better conscience,
yet you do this to me?
Royal Prince, appease your anger.
Did the French also celebrate Spring Festival?
Royal Prince, calm down.
Royal Prince.
I've received news that.
Sun Wen insists on a Republic. They will not compromise.
Empress Dowager,
I tell you the story of the French Revolution
because I don't want you and the princes
to share the same fate.
I'm loyal to you.
Heaven can attest to it.
Yuan Shikai,
come over here.
Come over here.
Empress Dowager
I'm at your command.
What if
that day comes?
You won't let Us
face the guillotine,
you won't let us starve.
Certainly.
Go back.
The South is eager to resume battle,
Empress Dowager, please ponder this.
I know.
I take my leave.
- Prince Regent. - Here.
Yuan Shikai has broken his promise,
he's banded with the rebels.
I do regret this.
I dismiss him as Prime Minister.
Things have developed thus.
It won't help.
They're still dragging their feet, prolonging their dynasty?
They are acting against people's wishes.
How they overreach themselves.
They're becoming enemies of all people.
What a pipe dream,
thinking they can still hang on.
What happened?
Mr. Sun.
What is it?
Send a telegram,
make it public.
The Revolutionary Party's patience is running out.
Don't these feudalists have any shame?
Reporting to the Empress Dowager:
Our Ambassador to Russia and others have sent telegrams to you,
hoping that you treasure the Chinese people rather than insisting on one man's position.
There are mutinies in the Northeast, Xinjiang and Tibet.
43 generals, including Feng Guozhang and Duan Qirui,
have signed a petition in support of the Republic.
Tell me something I don't already know.
Empress Dowager.
We have served you and the royal court. We do not support the idea of a Republic.
Please do not falter in your position.
Why would I falter?
It's all Yuan Shikai's doing.
Yuan had betrayed Emperor Guangxu,
now he betrays Emperor Xuantong.
He's a real traitor.
His family has received such grace from the court,
yet he's such an unfilial cur.
He has the ambition of Wang Mang in becoming Emperor.
If the Emperor doesn't abdicate,
he can't make his deal.
I'd told you before, he's not to be trusted.
As long as Aisin Gioro is here,
the Qing Dynasty will not fall.
Ancestors in Heaven,
HOW
other countries bully us,
the Revolutionaries run wild,
our ministers are corrupt,
they sell whatever they can
for their own gains.
There's nothing left now.
We have failed you.
At least Sun Wen
is Clement.
He doesn't invade the Palace,
there are no guillotines.
We want a bloodless revolution,
no more sacrifices...
or needless killings.
Abdicate.
Friends, greetings.
This is a historical day,
let's begin.
- Mr. President, this way. - Let's
have a pose.
How?
- Mr. President, please lift up your hat. - OK.
Let's change a bit.
Mr. President, this way.
Mr. President, you look so young.
Such glib words.
When you cut my queue,
don't hurry,
take your time,
move slowly.
This is a historical moment, do you understand?
Yes.
You talk about Revolution and Republic all the time.
A Revolutionary has to have a Revolutionary look.
Let me show you.
Look.
Ambassadors,
Today I meet you as the Provisional President
for the first time,
also the last time.
I can't believe this.
Before I leave the Presidency,
I hope you will request your respective governments
to recognize our new country.
To you
and to the entire world,
this is truly significant.
Mr. President,
how do you plan to treat the Qing royal family?
They'll become citizens of the Republic.
The Revolutionary Party has decided
to pay the royal family 4 million taels of silver.
Is that how you treat your citizens?
Money cannot be a measure here.
Not all revolutions need guillotines.
What do you say, Mr. Ambassador?
I agree.
When I was in England,
I once met one of your parliament members, Mr. Hillier.
I told him,
when China is freed,
I'd invite him as my guest.
I'll use Chinese liquor,
Revolutionary liquor, to toast him.
Come,
cheers.
Minbao, Xinwenbao and other newspapers
nave published articles questioning your decision to step down.
I read them.
We're in financial trouble.
We can't find funds for restitutions to the martyrs' families.
We must find some money
no matter how.
People's representatives want to meet you.
Please set up a time.
Yes.
Homer Lea is determined
to resign from his post as Military Advisor.
What's his reason?
He said he won't Work with Yuan Shikai.
Tell him,
he's helping China,
not just a person.
This is a letter from Juemin.
Yat-serfs been Keeping it for you.
He asks that I give it to you.
A few days ego, members of the Tongmenghui came to see me.
They are planning a new grave.
They asked that I prepare a funerary outfit.
I went to the shop.
When he was alive,
Juemin and I always made decisions together.
So I asked,
Juemin,
which one do you want?
Only then did I know
he's no longer with me.
Zhongxin,
this is a letter from your father.
Look.
"Letter to My Wife"
shouldn't be kept only in this household.
Keep it,
let others know about it.
Yesterday,
the Qing Emperor abdicated,
ending two millennia of monarchy.
Countless revolutionaries have given up their lives
for our new Republic.
Today,
February 13, 1912,
26th day of the 12th moon of the Xinhai Year.
Keep my promise,
I resign from the post of President.
We strive for the success of the Revolution,
but do not covet recognition.
We are all of the same minds
to realize the goal of Revolution.
The goal is to establish
an independent country for the Chinese people.
We build a Chinese Republic where land is divided among all.
Nationalism, democracy, livelihood:
These are what we strive to attain,
Three Principles.
Today you ask me,
what does Revolution mean?
Perhaps people will ask the same question a century later.
Qiu Jin, our Tongmenghui member who was killed in Shaoxing, said,
Revolution will provide all children
a peaceful and gentle world.
Lin Juemin, one of the martyrs of Huanghuagang, wrote this to his wife:
Revolution seeks eternal happiness for everyone in the World.
I believe
the Revolution enables a republican system
to reach the people.
People will understand we'll fight whoever
dares support the monarchy.
Revolution enables factories,
banks, rail roads, mines
owned by Chinese to benefit the people.
Revolution enables our Chinese race to become strong,
no longer bullied by others.
We will no longer be slaves.
Revolution can take place anywhere,
anytime,
in any heart,
forever,
forever,
no longer afraid of foreign powers,
ridding the country of feudalism and royalty.
No one will be impoverished,
and the Chinese people can stand tall in the East.
This is the meaning of Revolution.

Gentlemen...
On behalf of the business community
in Kiangsu and Anhui
and the 9th Nanyang Revolutionary Army,
I nominate Ch'en Ch'i-mei as Military Governor
in charge of the Shanghai garrison.
I'm honoured by my comrades' nomination...
Objection!
I object!
From Hsu Hsi-lin to Ch'iu Chin,
members of the Restoration Society
have sacrificed for the cause.
You're not qualified for the position!
Mr. T'ao,
to draw a line with Chinese United League
is inappropriate.
This is segregation!
You're not up for the task!
T'ao Ch'eng-chang,
this is counter-revolutionary!
You have no right to label me!
I'm telling you,
even if Sun Yat-sen were here today
it's still unacceptable.
Under Emperor Shun-chih,
you needed a pigtail to keep your head.
Business was great back then.
Now, it's the exact opposite,
you'll lose your head if you wear a pigtail.
Recruiting for the New Army!
Join the New Revolutionary Army!
Hurry up and enrol!
Hurry up and enrol!
I repeat,
Join the New Army!
Join the revolution!
I'll sign up!
Dr. Sun's position is clear.
The Emperor's abdication is a prerequisite.
Peiyang Clique's bottom line is equally simple.
Yuan Shih-k'ai must become President
to counter the Ch'ing court
and force the Emperor to abdicate.
Dr. Sun made it clear,
end monarchy, stop the war
set up a republic, anything else is negotiable.
I ascended the throne at a young age,
during a time of great upheavals,
I understand the will of the people,
that honour and glory of one family
should not come before it.
I wish that people can live on in peace
- among all ethnic groups. - Your Majesty,
- Bringing everyone under one roof
- don't play with that in court.
- to form the Republic of China. - Why not?
The Emperor will step down
and continue to enjoy a monarch's privileges
Don't cry,
and personally experience this new era
because you're the Emperor.
which can only be great.
So decreed.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Though I'm unfit to become President,
upon President Sun's recommendation,
and the support of all ethnic groups,
I shall do my best
to make the Republic of China strong.
We now live in a republic, no more "long live"...
"Joint Harmony" dates back to Chou Dynasty.
According to "Records of the Grand Historian"
during the regency under Dukes Shao and Chou
state affairs were discussed
until consensus was reached.
I see.
The Emperor is gone, now we can all have a say.
Forget it!
Tse-tung,
who do you think should be President?
Dr. Sun.
Then why did Yuan get the job?
Because he has guns.
Before Dr. Sun stepped down,
he pushed through the Provisional Constitution
which will become the foundation.
A new President won't change the Republic's fate.
Party politics is our platform.
We may have conceded a title,
but as long as we win the election,
we can appoint our own cabinet members.
I'm afraid he is too aggressive.
Gentlemen, the Presidency is symbolic,
he can be anybody, or nobody.
We must dismantle one party to build another.
Let's turn the faltering Chinese United League,
whose aim was to overthrow Ch'ing Dynasty,
into Kuomintang, a true nationalist party,
the foremost political party for the Republic.
Sir!
Party politics determines
the polity of the Republic,
you must take it seriously.
Here we are!
Conduct a democratic, non-violent election,
insist on fair competition,
unite the Party!
This is important, remember it well.
I will.
Thank you.
I won't forget!
- Take care! - Take care!
- Take care! - Goodbye!
Chiao-jen!
I fear his thinking is too aggressive...
Chiao-jen!
Chiao-jen!
My mother...
Iives on humble means.
- Chiao-jen! - When I die...
I count on you...
to look after her.
Chiao-jen!
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
Hang in there!
Hang in there, Chiao-jen!
- Hang in there. - Chiao-jen!
Chiao-jen!
Chiao-jen!
At dawn on the day of the Sacrificial Rites,
the President changes with officials in attendance
then lights the ceremonial pyre,
offers jade and satin,
offers roast meat, reads first prayer...
Shih-ch'ang, the entire country seems to have
different opinions on the polity.
It's either the Japanese absolute monarchy,
the French parliamentary system,
or the American presidential system.
Which is more suitable for us?
Japanese monarchy is outdated
for a republic like ours.
That's the crux of the problem,
if we keep changing our minds,
we'll be neither here nor there.
What are you suggesting?
Follow Japan, adopt constitutional monarchy.
Had we persisted initially with that,
China would have been one of the Powers
and won't have to be bullied by foreign aggressors.
What about you, Yuan-hung?
Your wish is my command, Your Excellency.
Enough of rhetoric, this is now a Republic.
General Ts'ai!
Ts'ai O!
What are you doing?
Sir, I...
You like that?
I'll send you some later.
Thank you.
What comes after the first prayer?
Second and third prayer,
then the burning of the sacrificial offerings,
and everybody will bow in four directions.
Firstly, allow Japan to inherit
all German interests in Shantung
and agree not to cede or lease Shantung to others.
Secondly, Japanese subjects are permitted
into Southern Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia
to engage in commercial,
industrial and mining activities.
The leases on Port Arthur and Dalny,
and management of the Antung-Mukden Railway
shall be extended by 99 years.
That's daylight robbery!
Prime Minister Okuma must be out of his mind!
Is your Prime Minister out of his mind?
This document...
how can you explain to the Western Powers?
This is confidential.
Both parties have a duty to keep it as such.
Sir,
whoever leaks the contents,
regardless of his esteemed position,
will be sanctioned by Japan.
Spare me this bullshit!
Even Ito Hirobumi dared not threaten me
when he was alive.
Who do you think you are?
Your Excellency,
neither the late Ito-san
nor the Western Powers can save your skin.
Only we can do that.
Don't you want to be Emperor of China?
Have you heard?
Yuan Shih-k'ai accepted Japan's 21 Articles.
He's a traitor!
We're organising a protest, hurry...
Let's go, Tse-tung!
The strength of the Western Powers
Iies in their ability to tolerate opposition.
In Chu Chih-hsin's
"An Introduction of German social Revolutionaries"
he mentioned two western philosophers,
by the name of Marx and Engels.
Tu-hsiu!
Excuse me!
What is it?
Look!
What Yuan did was treacherous!
It's time we go home.
I heard you wish to restore monarchy.
Is that true?
Kuo-chang, you're one of us, I'll level with you.
All founding emperors in history were under 50,
I'm almost 60, too old to have this ambition.
That's good!
Whoever wants to be Emperor,
will suffer the wrath of the nation.
Sir, I must hurry back to Nanking, goodbye!
Having set the polity, with Heaven's mandate
and the will of the people ascends to the throne
and rules.
By virtue of an unanimous vote,
the Representative Assembly of the Republic
is in favour of the President
in becoming the Emperor of China.
Long live the Emperor!
Long live His Majesty!
I'm overwhelmed by your support.
I hear you insist on taking cold baths,
and advocate saving the country with able bodies.
I used to.
Not now?
I'm a bit lost.
With a weak country and inept Peiyang government,
able bodies are useless.
Guns and cannons against bows and arrows,
the outcome is obvious.
Look what happened in Shantung.
You have the answer?
Not yet, sir.
Talk is cheap,
finding the way out
may take a lifetime,
even generations.
Dad!
This is my daughter K'ai-hui,
this is Mao Tse-tung.
You're so tall.
I'll go out and play.
The question I ask of you is
what do you really want?
Say goodbye to Feng-hsien!
I wish I could bring you along.
Why don't you?
You pretended to support Yuan Shih-k'ai
so he'll let you go to Japan for treatment.
You don't want to arouse suspicion by taking me.
I only want to know, is a courtesan
really that important?
Everyone knows
I'll forsake my country for my beloved.
Without me, who'll take care of you?
Promise me you'll come back alive.
Unfortunately,
I've pledged this body and soul
to my country, not you.
Listen, you belong to 400 million Chinese
as well as to me, Hsiao Feng-hsien.
I know.
I appeal to all of you
to answer to a call of duty.
Should Yuan refuse to come to his senses,
he will be punished by an army of justice.
An army of justice?
Well said!
But where's your army?
General Ts'ai is here, sir!
Here comes my army!
You look so frail!
- Dr. Sun, I... - Take your time...
Have a seat!
Reviving the monarchy is a regression.
It's fatal to China. We must launch an expedition.
Commander-in-chief,
Captain Chu Te of the 6th detachment is here.
Go ahead.
Enemy troops defending Mienhuapo
are led by Wu of Peiyang's 6th Brigade.
Take the advance guard off duty,
Iet them rest.
We'll attack tomorrow at dawn.
We must capture Mienhuapo within a day.
Yes, sir!
Bring up all our heavy artillery.
Who the hell is their commander?
Wu P'ei-fu!
Son of a bitch!
What's going on here?
Feng Kuo-chang and the generals just declared
their opposition to the new polity.
And the Military Governor Lu Jung-t'ing
has declared Kuanghsi independent.
The country is in uproar!
Perhaps we should postpone the accession rites.
It's mere formality.
It now depends on Chen Huan and Ts'ao K'un,
if they can defeat Ts'ai O in Szechuan,
we might still have a chance.
Ts'ai is hounding me to my grave...
I'd high hopes for you, but you let me down.
Mr. Fan Ching-sheng, the Minister of Education
will now confer the letters of appointment.
On behalf of the Ministry of Education
and the National Peking University Council,
I appoint Ch'en Tu-hsiu
as Dean of the School of Letters,
Chu Hsi-chu as lecturer in Literature,
Li Ta-chao as Head Librarian,
and Ku Hung-ming as English Professor.
Isn't he the renowned academic?
Why does he dress like that?
What's so funny?
I wear my pigtail at the back of my head,
those who laugh at me wear it in their hearts.
Mine is visible,
yours is not.
Feel free to enjoy it.
How dare you! This is the Senate,
the sacred ground of the Republic.
What sacred ground?
Just a bunch of pathetic scholars
who are doomed to fail.
What do you mean, General?
I'm Peiyang's Joint Chief Military Governor,
Chang Hsun is my name.
I'm here to settle the dispute with the Senate,
Understand? I hereby proclaim
effective immediately
this dump is closed, the party is over.
Understand?
The Senate is the Republic's legislative body,
you have no right to close it down.
Listen...
I'm not only shutting down
this cackling dump of a Senate,
I'm also closing down
your bloody Republic.
Long live Your Majesty!
You may rise.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
I'm late, Your Majesty!
You may look up when you speak.
Without Your Majesty, the country is at a loss.
268 years of the glorious Ch'ing Dynasty
must not be ended by that Sun Yat-sen.
They bullied you because you're a child.
They took advantage of your age.
Alright... I appoint you as my Cabinet Minister
Viceroy of Zhili, Minister of Peiyang,
with the title of First Lord.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
You may run three laps around the Palace.
His Majesty allows you to also fly a kite.
It's flying!
Flying...
Your Majesty,
Look!
It's airborne!
Don't be scared. This is outrageous!
We still have a proclamation to make...
Don't force him to be Emperor,
we only want to be safe.
Traitor!
I, Tuan Ch'i-jui, Premier of the Republic of China
and Commander-in-Chief of the expedition force,
hereby condemn Chang Hsun and his clique
for forcibly dissolving the Senate,
holding the President hostage
and restoring monarchy.
Such action is contemptible
and against the will of the people and Heaven.
I, Tuan Ch'i-jui,
resuming as Premier on President Li's instruction
will lead a punitive expedition
to crush the traitors.
July 2, this 6th year of the Republic.
It's time for us students to take action.
Go to Peking and rally against the restoration.
I don't understand.
About what?
By conceding the presidency to Yuan
the Senate has made a fatal error.
The problem with China
is not just about choosing the wrong President!
Isn't that a reason?
If all fault lies with the head of state,
then the problems we had before
were Yuan Shih-k'ai's fault.
But what about the restoration fiasco?
Who should we blame?
What are you getting at?
Today's China
cannot be changed by having a
different Emperor or President.
An utmost humiliation!
The Chinese race has been shamed!
Republic is a must and demanded by the people.
Yet in a mere six years,
we already have two emperors.
Remember, China is a republic,
to have an emperor in a republic
is so utterly ironic.
Bravo!
The Republic champions freedom,
equality and philanthropy.
Yet, since the founding of the Republic,
equality has been ignored, freedom trampled on,
philanthropy does not exist.
Lives were lost and blood was shed
in exchange for a republic in name only.
That is intolerable!
Is this the Republic
people have sacrificed for?
It is unacceptable legally and to the Assembly,
and to the 400 million Chinese subjects.
Down with Chang Hsun!
Down with P'u-yi!
Down with Chang Hsun!
Down with P'u-yi!
Down with Chang Hsun! Down with P'u-yi!
Despite the 1 91 1 Revolution
and the rallying cry for the Republic,
people still worship Confucius
without learning the essence of democratic freedom.
Looking back over history for the past decades,
each time there's a failed republican movement,
monarchism will make another comeback.
Just like Yuan and Chang's attempts to restore.
Fellow students!
Feudalism and the republic are incompatible.
To keep one, the other must be destroyed.
In order for this country to be strong,
we must first remove this ancient burden
from the hearts of the people.
You're shamelessly boastful, Mr. Ch'en.
You praise New Culture and bury the old
and blame all our troubles on Confucianism.
What did Confucius do 2,000 years ago
that is damaging today?
Mr. Ku, as an erudite scholar,
can't you see what Confucius advocated then
is not applicable to us today?
What Confucius taught us
is like arithmetics.
2,000 years ago, 3 x 3 = 9. It still is today.
It will never be 8.
Blaming your miscalculations
on the person who invented arithmetics is absurd.
If you call that New Culture, it's bullshit.
Clearly a talent despite his quibbling!
Culture needs reforms
to keep up with time.
Some say classical Chinese is refined
while vernacular Chinese is vulgar.
But imperial examination system was harmful.
Even the best written eight-legged essays
were detached from society and impractical.
They're useless except in examinations.
Our country needs talents,
pragmatism will make us strong.
I represent the Women's College of Education,
I think classical Chinese is more concise.
That's a fact!
Please cite an example.
Take the phrase "unable to do it"
Isn't it more concise in classical Chinese?
That's four words.
You use only three in vernacular Chinese.
Such as?
"Can't be done!"
Bravo!
Before the 1 91 1 Revolution,
we modelled after Japan.
But it doesn't appear to be working.
Japan's Meiji Restoration was inspired by the West.
Why don't we learn from the teacher
but choose to follow the student?
It's not about Japanese or Americans.
It's a matter of new versus old culture.
To strengthen the country and enlighten its people,
we must abolish the old and popularize the new.
That's how our nation can be re-born.
Who should we learn from?
Whether it's the U.S., France
Japan, or even Russia.
- Learn from whoever can help China.
- Russia?
That's absurd!
The governance of any country in the world
is a way of thinking that stems
from its own culture.
Look at the world,
taking a macro view of the future of humanity,
is not absurd at all.
There's a man in Russia called Lenin,
who succeeded with the Bolshevik revolution.
The ideology he introduced
is Marxism from Germany.
What is Bolshevik?
Bolshevik means majority.
What is majority? Peasants and workers.
The many millions of oppressed labourers.
The success of Russia
is a victory for Bolshevism,
common people and the proletariat,
for the first time ever in the history of mankind,
and also the greatest.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Peiyang is up for grabs after Yuan's death.
Tuan Ch'i-jui used Chang Hsun
to get rid of Li Yuan-hung,
then he took out Chang Hsun.
Now he's using Wu P'ei-fu against Dr. Sun.
There's no end to this war.
If this continues, Hu'nan will be in ruins.
What about the Constitutional Protection Movement?
To succeed, Dr. Sun must launch
a northern expedition,
and Hu'nan will bear the brunt.
KMT should be stronger than the Peiyang Clique.
By some distance.
But in-fighting among various factions
makes KMT vulnerable.
What's your view?
Declare Hu'nan autonomous.
Sir...
Sir...
He's in a bad mood, I'm so sorry.
First the south, then the north.
Now it's north against south! There's no end to it!
There's no end to this revolution
You-jen, what are we missing?
Madam, same as before,
no money, no guns, no troops.
Fellow students,
I believe France is the hub
of European civilisation,
the standard-bearer of modern revolution,
and a model for global revolution.
Then let's go to France.
But...
to go abroad
we need money.
We'll raise it.
Let's split up,
Peking, Shanghai and Canton.
Tse-tung, where do you want to go?
Peking.
Peking?
I can visit Mr. Yang at Peking University.
Which faculty are you from?
My name is Mao Tse-tung, sir, graduate of
First Provincial Normal School of Hu'nan.
I'm visiting, came across your class,
and took the liberty of sitting in.
Mr. Mao, not that I won't let you,
but Peking University has its rules.
I'm a great admirer of yours,
I only wish to sit in for one session.
I'll leave quietly afterwards.
Take a seat.
Thank you.
The university is not a sanctuary,
anyone not properly dressed won't be admitted.
That's the rule here!
In any case,
because of Hu Shih's huge reputation
I don't want to miss his lecture.
What brings you to Peking?
To raise money for my alumni to go to France.
Ta-chao.
This student of mine...
what should we do with him?
You're...
Mr. Li Ta-chao?
I need an assistant.
Are you willing to work hard?
Absolutely!
I'll do anything anytime.
8 silver dollars a month.
That's plenty.
More than I make as a soldier.
You're a soldier?
Yes, but never went to war.
Close the door, thank you.
You are...
It's me!
K'ai-hui!
Today, we leave for the Paris Peace Conference.
For the first time in 1 00 years,
China shows up on international stage as a victor.
We won't let our nation down!
Let's brace ourselves
and demand for the return of Shantung.
Unite...
and China shall prevail!
Justice shall prevail!
Look! Behind us
are 400 million Chinese.
But a weak nation lacks diplomatic clout.
We shall join you in Paris later.
My words carry little weight,
but I'll do my best for the Republic.
Unite...
Justice shall prevail!
Sir, I once thought
our nation can be saved by strong mind and body,
or even by Kropotkin's anarchism.
But these solutions now seem superficial.
I read your review on Marxism
I think that is the truth.
My article is a mere glimpse of Marxism.
It's a fraction of what it is about.
You should study "The Communist Manifesto"
and its theory of a proletariat revolution.
That's the truth.
"The Communist Manifesto"
I forgot today is New Year's eve.
Stay for dinner.
Sir!
I still have work to do.
It's dad's prescribed hours!
We can now eat New Year dinner.
Great!
Wipe your hands!
Victory of the common people?
Didn't Uncle Li write this?
Yes, it's about the Russian revolution.
How is it different?
Most revolutions are led by the elite.
But in Mr. Li's thesis,
Russian revolution is a victory
of the common people.
Common people?
Let's have a drink.
I don't drink.
Just one, for the New Year.
Alright.
Let's go watch the fireworks.
Hurry up!
Coming...
Shantung is the cradle of Chinese civilisation,
great thinkers like Confucius and Mencius
were born in Shantung.
China cannot lose Shantung,
Iike the West can't be without Jerusalem.
Concerning the problem of Shantung,
the governments have already
signed a treaty of 21 Articles.
So it is not necessary to discuss
it in this conference.
At the Paris Peace Conference,
Japan proposed that German concessions in Shantung
should be transferred to them permanently.
As expected.
Hu Shih and I
intend to write to President Wilson,
and force him to mediate.
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.
That's Yang's student, Mao Tse-tung.
Tse-tung, please come down.
Japan's ambition in China
is clearly a threat to American interests.
Wilson must do something.
Mr. Ch'en,
if Japan refuses to withdraw its troops,
will the U.S. send its fleet
to Kiautschou Bay for us?
So Wilson's Fourteen-Points
is bullshit?
He's right. Between Japan and China,
the Powers can only choose to support one.
They have never backed us in the past.
They supported Japan
because they wanted her to contain Russia.
They need to contain Russia now more than ever,
don't they?
Thank you, comrades!
Sending you to Peking
is to raise money,
but you spent your time reading in the library.
He's a genuine bookworm.
We can't go to France without money.
Going back to Hu'nan empty handed
is so humiliating.
A cashier's cheque
for 20,000 silver dollars!
Where did you get this?
Chang Shih-chao raised it at Mr. Yang's request.
Mao Tse-tung...
You left me speechless!
Do I have to pay it back?
Of course!
I'm going back to Hu'nan tonight
to make plans for France.
I need to stay on for a while.
You're not going?
Are you courting each other?
I have to go now!
Money!
Do you have to go?
I made a promise.
Will you come back?
Of course, the reason why I'm going
is to bring back more advanced learnings.
Mr. Yang is here,
Mr. Li, too,
and...
you.
Before I leave, I want to visit my parents.
If you don't come back,
I'll look for you in France.
Bad news from Paris!
We just got word,
the person who signed the loan agreement
with Japan last September
was Chang Tsung-hsiang, our envoy to Japan.
Chang Tsung-hsiang!
Traitor!
Something tumultuous is about to happen.
Because of the Peace Conference?
Yes!
If we succeed, the nation will rejoice.
If we fail...
Nationalism suppressed for centuries
will erupt like a volcano.
What should we do?
Just go with the flow.
We'll turn this world upside down.
Extra! Diplomatic failure in Paris!
Extra! Paris peace talk collapses...
Today,
Japan's conspiracy to take over Shantung
is about to succeed
due to our diplomatic failure.
If Shantung were taken by Japan,
our territorial integrity will be compromised,
and the nation will perish.
What should we do now?
Stage protests at foreign legation.
Calm down!
Don't lose sight of our objective!
We just want to be patriotic.
We're doing this to pressure
the Peiyang government.
Reclaim our sovereignty in Shandong.
All along,
we deluded ourselves into thinking
when the war is over
the Western Powers will help us.
Now we know
we have been betrayed
by the rhetoric of politicians at Versailles,
by the Western Powers
who are too busy carving up Europe to care.
And our government
had wanted to sign this humiliating treaty.
A historic moment is upon us.
Fellow students, take to the streets!
Return Tsingtao!
Defend our sovereignty!
Return Tsingtao!
Defend our sovereignty!
Return Tsingtao!
This is Wilson's so-called truth and justice!
The Western Powers betrayed us in Paris.
They betrayed China!
Betrayed 400 million Chinese!
Betrayed truth and justice!
Something so painfully obvious
but overlooked by the Peiyang government!
This Peiyang government
that can tolerate such humiliation
is not fit to govern us!
They are Western Powers' accomplices,
running dogs of the Japanese pirates!
In time of crisis, stand up and be counted!
Today, we want an eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth!
President Wilson is a scoundrel!
He deceived us!
He insulted us!
He toyed with us!
What should we do now?
Fellow countrymen,
Today, we shall petition President Hsu
and also the Premier.
We want people to know about the Paris conspiracy.
We want them to know our demands.
Whoever it is
who tries to wipe us out
will face a bloody battle!
Pay with blood!
Fight to the end!
Return Tsingtao!
Today's rally
is a harbinger of China's bright future.
So, this very moment, this very day...
I'm proud and honoured to be a part of
this unprecedented revolution.
Return our sovereignty!
Punish the traitors!
Students have taken to the streets,
they're heading for the Legation Quarter.
Ignorant, naive and stupid!
Send police to stop them!
Yes, sir!
Fight to the end!
Patriotism is not a crime!
Fight to the end!
Patriotism is not a crime!
Fight to the end!
Fellow students!
T'an Ssu-t'ung said
"successful reforms come with bloodshed",
So let bloodshed and sacrifice begin with us!
Charge!
Come out!
Young lady!
Take your grievances to the prosecutors!
You've come to the wrong place!
My grievances are beyond the prosecutors!
What do you mean?
I'm pleading for 400 million Chinese.
Come out!
Return Tsingtao!
Hand over the traitors!
Return Tsingtao!
Hand over the traitors!
Return Tsingtao!
Hand over the traitors!
Charge!
Charge!
Go inside and grab the traitors!
Open up...
Open the door!
We were under siege in Japan,
it's happening here as well!
Don't cry!
Look, Ping-hsiang!
Don't worry, I'm here.
3 Bamboos!
K'uang Hu-sheng, bravo!
Jump!
Jump inside!
Soldiers!
Teng Chung-hsia, Fang Ho!
Go, Fang Ho!
1...2...3...
1...2...3...
Quiet...
You should be fighting Japanese in Shantung
instead of guarding a traitor's house.
Comrades! Brothers...
We're one family!
I believe we're one family,
Those you're holding off
are your brothers and sisters.
Each and every one a patriotic student.
Move aside, let us through!
Protect our territory!
Protect our sovereignty!
Brothers!
Everyone of you is patriotic
Am I right?
Yes!
Are you Chinese?
Yes!
Then let us through!
Charge!
Students!
Tell me where he is!
Hand over the traitor!
Search the house! Step aside...
Students...
Listen, harbouring traitors
makes you also a traitor of China.
He's here!
Students!
I have nothing to do with it!
Where is Chang Tsung-hsiang?
I don't know!
Take him away!
Listen...
This is the desk on which the treaty was signed!
Burn it...
The police are here!
Are you Ts'ao Ju-lin?
No, I am not...
- No? Then who are you? - I'm really nobody,
just a visiting guest.
Where did they go?
They left.
How could you! That's Chang Tsung-hsiang!
After him...
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Consider China's 2,000-year-old history,
have you ever heard of
students involved in arson and killing?
They have no choice but to revolt.
Today...
President Hsu has arrested innocent students.
He did it to please our enemies.
As a staff member of the school,
I declare the school will go on strike
until the students are released.
Long live students...
Long live revolution...
What is it?
You wrote "The spirit of the Chinese People"
and I admired you for it.
Speaking of principles,
you should know our differences with foreigners.
But today,
you wrote in a Japanese-owned newspaper
denouncing the students as barbaric mobsters!
What has happened to your principles?
You're siding with the enemy.
Students, workers and merchants are all on strike.
Overnight, the whole country is in uproar.
Even soldiers are siding with the students.
This is a crucial moment, no compromise!
We mustn't go against the tide.
Tu-hsiu, what is it?
Have we won already?
Is this time for celebration?
Ridiculous!
Mr. Hu,
are you denouncing Ch'en Tu-hsiu and Li Ta-chao?
Why not?
You must have a sound argument.
Marx's doctrine is just a theory.
But such a theory
though proven successful in Russia
does not mean it's applicable in China.
We must not act like a parrot
and lose ourselves by following others.
To sit back and talk about theories
without solving the actual problems
is no different from Confucianism.
If this is what New Culture is about,
then it's meaningless.
For Ch'en and Li to model on Russia,
it's not going to solve our problems.
You're wrong, sir.
Confucianism is a feudal code,
Whereas Marx's doctrine is scientific.
You can't compare the two.
Esteemed delegates,
what right do you have to give Shantung to Japan?
I am furious.
Chinese people will never forget this painful day.
You wouldn't dare to kill Ch'en Tu-hsiu!
If he dies, there'll be hundreds more like him.
Tell Hsu not to make himself a public enemy.
If he still wants to continue as President,
he must release Ch'en Tu-hsiu at once.
You have suffered, Tu-hsiu.
Ch'en Tu-hsiu takes on the burden alone,
and sets an example for us all.
Peking University is proud of him.
Bravo, Mr. Ch'en!
So sorry...
- Over here! - What took you so long?
We got lost!
- Hello! - We'll do the introductions later,
Iet's get on board.
Come on...
Let's go!
Wait...
I'm thinking...
transplanting the experience of
a foreign revolution
does it really work?
Changed your mind again?
China has much more complex issues,
I'd better stay.
Good luck all... Till we meet again.
Give me some money!
Who is he?
Mao Tse-tung from Hu'nan.
What a shame he's not going!
Why did the Governor shut down the
"Shian Kian Review"?
Because we told the truth.
He's afraid the truth will come out
about Chang Ching-yao being Hu'nan's public enemy.
Workers, peasants and merchants have all suffered.
Fellow workers, Hu'nan will not tolerate Chang!
Hu'nan is finished with him around.
We're only poor workers
we have no say.
How do you write the word "work"?
A vertical stroke between 2 lines.
Yes, heaven above your head
with your feet on the ground.
The words "work" and "man" together
make the word "heaven".
It means the world under heaven.
Workers and peasants will rule the world.
Sounds too good to be true.
This is not my idea,
it belongs to a foreigner called Marx.
This foreigner advocated
equality of all men.
Adopting this theory,
the Russian workers now rule their own country.
Fellow workers, the revolution Marx spoke
of will be universal.
Chinese workers should follow suit.
Overthrow this corrupt and evil government
that bullied and oppressed us.
Yes...
Tse-tung, your telegram.
Tse-tung...
the doctor said dad had a stroke,
he can't talk, he can't hear.
His health has deteriorated so much in a year...
Before taken ill,
dad hadn't stopped speaking of you.
Remember...
the summer of 1 91 5
you asked me a question?
All these years,
I've been thinking hard.
I'm close to having an answer.
But...
Sir...
Dad...
As my wife,
Iife will be tough.
If you're with me,
you won't enjoy a stable life,
no bridal gowns, sedan chair or banquet.
Not even a witness or marriage license.
I'm willing.
The Governor wishes to meet your representatives.
Follow me!
Let them go!
You have no right to arrest us!
What are you doing? Let go!
What do you want?
Let go of me!
Let us out!
In this world,
who are the noblest people?
My answer to that...
is the working class.
Food, clothes, and even houses that we live in
are all created by workers.
We slave for a living,
but we're not well fed, clothed or sheltered.
Is that fair?
No!
Of course not!
That's why we must unite
and go on strike.
Confront these bourgeois factory owners
and show them our strength.
Reclaim what is rightfully ours.
Fellow workers,
in the future
workers will rule the world.
Long live workers!
Release the students!
Sir, these students haven't eaten in 3 days.
Who's not eating?
Let him starve to death!
He has no one but himself to blame.
Who wrote this?
I did.
These are our latest demands.
The hunger strike continues until they are met.
We want books and newspapers.
- Go ahead. - Yes!
We want New Year dinner.
I'll treat all 26 of you to dinner!
We'll even eat outside.
The Awakening Society needs a place to study.
Certainly.
What's your name?
Chou En-lai.
Why did you change your mind?
Didn't we agree to go on hunger strike?
Change of tactics.
Let's prepare for a long struggle!
Let's eat.
Goodbye!
Mr. Ch'en!
"Cops are after you, follow the student, Li Ta-chao"
Follow me!
If you leave Peking while on bail
and get arrested again,
it'll be difficult to get out.
I'll go back to Shanghai.
Scholars-in-arms are hopeless.
Don't say that!
Your arrest has shaken the nation.
That's as big an honour as you can get!
What are you studying these days?
The Russian Revolution.
Hu Shih was right about you!
The Russian Revolution is all you care about.
It's the last resort when all else have failed.
Now tell me,
why model after Russia?
The reason why the Russians succeeded
was because the Bolsheviks
united the workers and peasants,
the broadest social classes.
To unite the nation, you must first
unite peasants and workers.
To unite them,
China must first have its own Bolshevik.
Tu-hsiu, when you get to Shanghai,
that's exactly what you've to do.
We'll split up, you take the north, I go south,
form our own political party at once.
Easy...
When I get to Shanghai,
I'll send you your favourite candy.
You must keep your word!
Take care!
Take care!
We should help China
build her own Bolshevik Party.
The committee nominates Maring to assist.
Excellent, go right away!
Bravo!
What does the Shanghai dispatch say?
Each region should send two delegates
to the congress,
and the caucuses in Japan and Europe
will each send one delegate.
Peking, Shanghai, Canton,
Ch'ang-sha, Wuhan and Tsinan
will all be represented.
You and Ch'en Kung-po will represent Canton.
You two will represent Peking.
Remember,
you're there as my personal representative.
Aren't you attending?
The Comintern is attaching great importance to it.
If neither you nor Mr. Ch'en attend,
what's the point of having the congress?
Apologise to Comrade Maring for me.
Students are borrowing more books
for summer vacation.
I can't leave as Head Librarian.
I disagree with the Comintern on many issues,
if we argue during the congress
there will be no way back.
I see.
Remember,
Ch'en Tu-hsiu and I must act in unanimity.
I understand.
This should be enough for a month,
when you get to Shanghai, spend when you have to.
Dad left this,
you have it.
No, you keep it.
Don't be late for the congress.
No!
Just take it.
I'm leaving,
take good care of yourself.
Let me introduce myself,
Chang Kuo-t'ao from Peking.
Liu Jen-ching, also from Peking.
I'm Li Han-chun from Shanghai.
Li Ta from Shanghai.
Teng En-ming from Tsinan.
Wang Chin-mei from Tsinan.
Tung Pi-wu from Wuhan.
Ch'en Tan-ch'iu from Wuhan.
Chou Fo-hai from Japan.
Pao Hui-seng, representing Ch'en Tu-hsiu.
Nice to meet you.
Ho Shu-heng from Chang-sha.
- This comrade from Chang-sha is...
- Tse-tung,
it's been a while.
Indeed, Kuo-t'ao.
My apologies, gentlemen...
Sorry for being late.
Hello, everyone.
I'm Ch'en Kung-po from Canton.
Who's the lovely lady?
My wife.
Greetings, I'm Li Li-chuang.
But we can't accommodate a couple...
I'm sorry...
We've a room at Tatung Hotel across the street.
Bringing your spouse to the congress?
Everyone...
This is my wife, Wang Hui-wu.
I'm working the reception.
Look for me if you need anything.
We've all had long trips, get some rest.
Meet at my brother's place tomorrow.
1 06 rue Wantz.
I'm most honoured
to represent Ch'en Tu-hsiu and Li Ta-chao
to chair the First National Congress.
Let me introduce to you
Comrade Maring,
an observer from Comintern.
Mao Tse-tung will be our secretary.
The first item on the agenda
is to decide on the name of the party.
Our view regarding the name of the party
is clear-cut.
From the "The Communist Manifesto",
we adopt the word "Communist"
and call it the Chinese Communist Party.
In his letter to Tse-tung,
Ts'ai Ho-san is also in favour.
Maring wants to know Li Ta-chao's view.
Mr. Li's preference is
Chinese Communist Party.
I agree.
Agreed.
Agreed.
Unanimously passed.
Rickshaw-man,
Tung Fang Hotel on Nanking Road.
Let's go to Palace Hotel instead.
We're switching hotels?
We're being followed.
Be careful, don't look around.
Palace Hotel.
Got it!
Is there another exit?
There's a back entrance for the staff.
Wait for us there in five minutes.
Sure!
Why are we being followed everywhere?
I'm sorry, sir.
The first floor is full,
is the second floor alright?
Alright!
Jump!
Stupid idiots...
Go look for them!
Find them in three days or else!
Sir, my brother is with the Green Gang
finding someone in Shanghai is a piece of cake.
The Peking caucus has 1 3 members,
including Li Ta-chao, Chang Kuo-t'ao,
Lo Zhang-lung, Liu Jen-ch'ing,
Ch'en Te-jung, Teng Chung-hsia,
Kao Chun-yu, Miu Po-ying, Ho Meng-hsiung,
Chu Wu-shan, Fan Hung-chieh, Wu Ju-ming.
Heads up, everyone!
A draft platform of the CCP
is hereby pronounced
for delegates to comment and discuss.
Proletariat must join force
with the revolutionary army
and overthrow the bourgeois regime;
they must help the working class
until the class system is abolished,
and until the class struggle has ended.
Meaning, when class system is finally abolished,
a proletariat dictatorship will be established.
Liaise with the Comintern,
and adopt the Soviet model.
Unite workers, peasants and soldiers
and adopt social revolution as our goal.
Those who accept the Party's platform and policies,
and willing to be loyal members,
upon the introduction of a Party member,
regardless of gender and nationality
can be admitted as Party members
and become our comrades.
But...
before their initiation into the Party,
they must sever all ties
with other parties and organisations
whose platforms are contradictory to ours.
Tomorrow is the last day of the congress,
the main agenda
is to adopt the platform
and election of the Central Committee.
Comrades Maring and Nikolsky
will attend tomorrow's closing session.
Rickshaw!
Sorry, we had to make a detour.
Is everyone here?
Chou Fo-hai is in the toilet,
he'll be right back.
It's that Chou again!
Let's not wait.
The draft platform we tabled yesterday,
can continue to be discussed now.
I have a comment.
Regarding nationality...
Can I help you?
Looking for someone?
What do you want?
Who are you looking for?
Chairman Wang of the Social League.
There's no Social League
or Chairman Wang.
I'm sorry...
Maring calls for an immediate recess.
I agree with Comrade Maring.
Let's adjourne.
This is my home. What are you doing here?
Why do you organise meeting in your house?
What meeting? I was entertaining guests.
That two are from which country?
Which two?
The two foreigners.
They're Dutch.
Pack up and be ready to move out!
Sir.
What do you do for a living?
Professor.
Him?
My colleague.
Today I can close your house and catch your people.
Because you are teaching in university,
I'll let you free.
If not, you will burn yourself.
I won't.
How is it?
It's fine.
Comrade Maring said we must leave Shanghai.
I suggest we go to Chiahsing
rent a boat for the meeting.
Is Maring coming?
He's too obvious a target,
for our safety, he's not going.
Alright!
What time do we leave?
There's a train tomorrow at 1 0:00am.
Does Ch'en Kung-po know?
I'll go get him tomorrow morning.
Are you under surveillance?
Probably not, it was an accident.
Let's go home.
The meeting is not yet over.
To form a national party with just 50 people,
this has to be a joke!
A gun!
Don't stare!
Homicide at Tatung Hotel!
Tatung Hotel?
That's where Ch'en Kung-po stays!
Kung-po left for Kwangtung already.
Yesterday two people died at their hotel.
His wife was petrified. So they left.
It was a lovers' suicide pact!
Cowards!
Let's go.
Comrades, we have reached the critical hours.
The last item on the agenda,
is to elect the Party Central Committee.
Under democratic principles,
we shall vote for
members of the Central Committee.
We should have 1 3 delegates,
but only 12 are in attendance.
After the vote,
Ch'en Tu-hsiu, Chang Kuo-t'ao and Li Ta
are elected Central Committee members,
Ch'en Tu-hsiu is named General Secretary.
Meeting is concluded.
Comrades,
I'd like to recite from "The Communist Manifesto"
to illustrate my thrill and excitement.
The Communists disdain to conceal
their aims and views.
They openly declare
that their ends can be attained
only by the forcible overthrow
of all existing social conditions.
Let the ruling classes tremble
at a communist revolution.
The proletarians have nothing to lose
but their chains.
They have a world to win.
Proletarians of all countries, unite.
Proletarians of all countries, unite.
Proletarians of all countries, unite...
Proletarians of all countries...
...unite

Director Chen, it appears
you will kiss and make up with the CPC.
You don't approve?
You don't know the CPC
like we do.
While you were making passes at them,
we fought them head on
in France.
I heard you intend to resign.
Even if you resign,
wait till after the capitulation ceremony in Nanjing
You helped defeat the Japanese.
The ceremony needs a national hero like you.
If I don't resign,
I'll be blamed for the civil war.
Welcome, Mr. Mao
Welcome to Chongqing, Mr. Mao.
We've been fighting the enemy
for 8 years.
It's my job
to fight till the end.
Now that we won,
why
are we stilling fighting?
I will not
fight my own kind.
General Malinovsky has agreed
to hand over the Northeast provinces.
No need to fight anymore?
If we don't,
will the CPC hand over their turf?
Ladies and gentlemen.
Chairman Chiang and Mr. Mao propose a toast
To peace, cheers.
Cheers.
Chairman Chiang.
Hello, Chairman Chiang
Hello, Mr. Mao.
I'm from the "Central Daily".
I notice you're both wearing Mandarin suit.
On a special day like today,
is there a special meaning for that?
The Mandarin suit
is the official attire for all civil servants of the Nationalist Government.
As the Chairman
of KMT,
it's my duty
to welcome Mr. Mao to Chongqing.
I'm wearing the Mandarin suit out of respect.
Mr Mao, is that your reason too?
The reason is simple
Chairman Chiang and I are both Dr. Sun's disciples.
Both the KMT and the CPC have inherited
Dr. Sun's revolutionary legacy.
We share the same roots.
It is only natural that
Dr. Sun's disciples should wear the Mandarin suits
Mr. Mao. Excuse me.
Pardon me, Mr Mao.
To see you standing next to each other,
I can't help but feel excited
I have another question for Mr. Mao
In the upcoming negotiation
ith regards to the issue of democracy,
will the Parties find common ground
or reach any consensus?
Definitely, if you look hard enough.
This reporter already noticed
we had something in common.
The North China division of the CPC
and the Shandong division
are infiltrating the Northeast
Chen Yi's New Fourth Army
is active around Shanghai and Hangzhou,
making it difficult for the Nationalist Government to move the capital back to Nanjing.
Our troops are too far away from these regions.
The Americans have landed in Qingdao.
They promised to send planes and warships
to get our troops to the Northeast, North China,
East China and south of Yangtze River
General Du, I'm counting on you in the Northeast
Master Zhang, please give us your honest opinion.
The CPC
likes to keep things in the open.
We never hide our views
and respect those of our friends and the China Democratic League.
Sir?
Thank you.
I'll be honest with you, as a friend.
To form a democratic coalition government,
peace and unity are the only ways forward.
If Mr. Chiang and Mr. Mao can sit down and talk,
it would be wonderful
A negotiation requires concessions and compromises
in order to bring about peace
Chairman Mao came to Chongqing
That alone proves our sincerity.
The turf and army are minor details.
Rather than haggle over them,
why not unify all the parties?
At this moment,
the Nationalist Army is busy
in regions where we have set up our regime
with strategic blockades or explorative attacks.
The Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army
are thorns in Mr. Chiang's flesh.
Pardon me for saying this
If we didn't have a few hundred thousand used guns,
Mr. Chiang would never sit down and talk to us.
Ze
If neither Party let go,
the war will go on.
You can forget about peace.
If neither Party gives in,
negotiation will break down.
I appreciate
your mediation.
Very well.
For the sake of peace and democracy,
we'll make the first concession
Among the 100 divisions of the national defense army,
our request for 48 divisions
has been cut back to 20 divisions
We're willing to give up 8 liberated regions
in south of Yangtze River.
I hope that our concession
will set the consultative meeting in motion
and help set up a coalition government.
I'm here on behalf of President Truman and the United States government
to issue the following statement.
We have no intention to support
a Cream of Wheat" Marxist to take over China.
The present Nationalist Government of China and Mr. Chiang Kai-shek
are faithful friends of the United States.
Our only concern is
whether the Yalta Conference and
the Sino-Russian Friendship Alliance Treaty
will be honored and implemented by the Chongqing government.
The United States is cognizant that
the Nationalist government of China is a one-party government
and believes that peace, unity and democratic reform in China
can be furthered if the basis of this government
is broadened to include
other political elements in the country.
On behalf of the CPC, I wish to issue the following statement.
We welcome President Truman's China policy as per the declaration on the 15th
with regards to the cease fire
between the KMT, CPC
and other political parties
and to call upon a multi-party meeting
to implement reforms
to end the KMT's one-party dictatorship
and to ensure fair and
effective representation of all parties
to facilitate the democratic unification of China.
President Truman's special envoy,
Marshall, is arriving soon
to mediate in the civil war.
Don't slight him.
Peace or war,
you should know better.
Stop when we want to stop
Fight when we want to fight.
This is the only case.
Not until we say so.
The purpose of this Assembly
is to seek political reforms towards democracy.
The basis of our negotiation
is to establish a multi-party coalition government
to facilitate a peaceful unification.
Kai,
there are over 30 seats in the Senate.
We have to give up 8 of them?
To give up 8 seats
is to oust 8 of our men
and hand them to someone else
Who owns the world now? It's hardly KMT.
Father
Central Club and the others have secretly agreed
not to acknowledge the CPPCC
and refused to give up their seats for the CDL and CPC.
There'II be trouble
if they keep this up.
Fellow students, teachers
and friends of Sichuan.
5 months ago, we gathered here
to celebrate a national victory.
That's outrageous. Lower your whip.
Mind your own business.
She's my girl.
You have no say
Whoever feeds her,
owns her
Hey Stop it.
Are you alright, Miss?
Who fired that shot? Who was it?
Who was it? Who fired that shot?
Sir.
No open fire in the city, Sir.
But they can beat people up?
I don't care who you work for.
Send a message for me.
Don't sneak around.
Stop this underhanded nonsense
Extra: Mr. Chiang calls for a meeting.
Newspaper.
Here
Chiang has taken the gloves off.
He's calling the National People's Congress without us.
It's his one-man show.
The sooner we set the date for the NPC,
the sooner the US will confirm their assistance.
We can't have the NPC with the KMT alone.
We can forget the CPC.
For appearance, we still have the other parties
The CPC and the other parties
insisted on implementing the resolution of the CPPCC in Chongqing.
What will you do?
Pacify Zhang Lan.
Coax and fight the CPC at the same time.
When Mao runs out of troops,
we can stop coaxing.
4 days ago in Kunming, Mr. Li Gongpu
was murdered by secret agents of the KMT.
What crime has he committed to deserve such a fate?
He used his pen and he spoke up.
Everything he wrote and said
was precisely what any Chinese with a conscience
should write and speak of.
What a shame.
The counter-revolutionaries' shame
is precisely Mr. Li's honor
His blood will not be shed in vain
Mr Li gave up his life
There's a price to be paid for his life.
Justice will prevail,
because truth will prevail
We want democracy, not civil war.
Tell him I went out.
Sir.
The Chairman is not here for real.
He sent me on an overseas expedition.
I came to say goodbye to my sworn brother.
But he's not here
Vice President, why the lantern?
It's broad daylight.
Daylight?
I see only darkness.
I can't see without a lantern.
You must be kidding, Sir.
I'm not in the mood
"The Three Principles of the People" is the cornerstone of our Party
If he's bent on having his way,
the days of our Party are numbered.
That's all I have to say.
Tell him to take care
Zhangjiakou is the capital of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region,
it's also the only major city under the CPC
that has an arsenal that's crucial to them.
But it'll be returned to the Nationalist Government soon.
General, are you saying
the manufacturing and military base of the CPC
doesn't exist any more?
I admire Mao for never giving up.
But talk is cheap
and you can't just work your finger to the bone
Power is everything.
According to you,
the Communist Party is doomed to fail this time?
I didn't say that
I'll make you a wager.
The CPC wins,
I'm willing to hold Mao's horsewhip.
20 years ago,
we surrendered our arms
for peace.
What happened? We got a massacre in return,
not peace.
We learn from our mistakes
For peace,
for our future and to eliminate war.
In this war imposed on us by our enemies,
we must retaliate.
Within 3 months of the closing of this NPC,
our government
will put an end to this civil war.
We will annihilate the separatist regime by force of arms
to bring forth a unified country
and bring peace to our nation.
Some say the evacuation from Yan'an
marks a major setback in the Chinese Revolution.
If this is a setback,
our party and this army
have survived countless setbacks.
You keep the land and lose the people, you lose both.
You keep the people and lose the land, you have both
I'll trade Yan'an for the whole of China.
We came all this way
but we're still one step away from peace
What a shame to give it up
Mao was right: Without guns in their hands,
Chiang will never negotiate with us
The CDL served as mediator between the KMT and CPC.
But Chiang is insatiable.
The CPC gave up their turf,
but they did not get the peace they wanted.
Some guarantor I am.
Chiang wants a one-party NPC.
If neither the CPC or CDL shows up,
we'll be handing the regime to him.
Don't be stupid
We'll fall into his trap if we show up.
Our position is clear.
Only a coalition government is legal
There'll be no NPC without peace
and no coalition government without political consultancy.
You're saying...
We side with the CPC
I, Zhang Lan,
will not attend Chiang's NPC.
Based on the experience of the Northeast Bureau,
we implement land reforms in the countryside.
The results are quite obvious.
Stay off the main road, take the vicinity of the city,
give the land to the farmers.
We'll take over when those who plough the land can own it
The supplies unit got separated.
We have problems with food and clothes.
Zedong.
Mr. Chairman.
I need to write an editorial for the Xinhua News Agency.
I need the rest of this candle for later
But we're having a meeting.
Precisely, just keep talking.
You don't need to see anything
Groping in the dark?
Let's get back to business.
Chiang threw caution to the wind and declared war.
Bullets don't have eyes.
In my opinion,
Enlai, Bishi and I
will form a front committee and stay in Shanbei
Shaoqi, you and Zhu De form a Central Working Committee
and cross the Yellow River into North China.
We'll work from both sides
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
Keep them separate.
We'II still have the other when one is crushed
Hurry. Get out
Get rid of everyone inside.
Seal up this place
That son of a bitch
He had the audacity to seize the CDL headquarters
and restrict our activities.
Li Jishen and He Xiangning
set up the Revolutionary Committee of the KMT in Hong Kong.
Founding members such as Feng Yuxiang and Cai Tingkai
have indicated their intention to break away from Chiang
The KMT is splitting up.
You should leave for Hong Kong right away
We'll re-open the CDL headquarters in Hong Kong
But...
I'm all for it
We must not miss this chance.
I hereby announce
the results of the first presidential election of the Republic of China
with the following votes:
Chiang Kai-shek 2, 430 votes;
Ju Zheng 269 votes.
According to the constitution of the ROC and electoral law,
I hereby announce
Mr. Chiang Kai-shek is elected first President of the ROC
Congratulations.
Congrats
Hu Zongnan wired. We lost Yan'an
Chiang Kai-shek was elected President in Nanjing.
Long live Mao Zedong in the valley.
Nothing to brag about
Get rid of the 'Iong live' in clause 23 of the slogan.
Let Chiang be the emperor.
I won't join his party
Clause 5,
mere mention of the working class is inappropriate.
We have insisted on a coalition government
It's bad to sing a different tune.
I agree with the amendments.
Let's have a show of hands
Go on air with this.
Xinhua Radio broadcasts
the CPC slogan for Labor Day on May 1.
First, this year's Labor Day
is the day the Chinese people head towards victory.
Second, this year's Labor Day
is the day the Chinese people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek
meets his doom.
Fifth, all democratic parties and organizations
should immediately call for the CPPCC
to discuss and elect delegates
to set up a coalition government.
The CPC made an excellent move
You're the chess expert.
This time you must make up your mind.
It's easier said than done.
It'll depend on the CPC's next move
I heard Li Zongren had invited you to Nanjing.
Chiang wants you too.
Li Zongren.
Sun Ke
Li Zongren.
If the President is a litearati,
I don't mind if you become Vice President
But the President is already a soldier
The Vice President should not be another soldier.
People will say this is a military government
Normally, I won't insist if you say so.
But since the election,
more than my effort is at stake.
Not that I don't want to step down,
I simply can't.
Without support from the Party,
you won't be elected.
Why be a laughing stock?
Let the numbers speak for themselves.
Maybe I'll win.
Definitely not.
Sun Ke 1, 295 votes.
Li Zongren 1, 438 votes.
According to the constitution of the ROC and electoral law,
I hereby announce, Mr. Li Zongren
is elected Vice President of the ROC.
I
do solemnly swear...
I haven't been to Beiping in years.
Commander-in-Chief of North China.
5 provinces and a few hundred thousand people under your command.
You're the king
Don't make fun of me.
Mr. Chiang has high regard for you.
If the new CPPCC
can invite half the people on this list,
we're half way there.
You're right.
You better write to General Feng personally.
I'll do that right now.
Mr Chairman, time to eat
Please join me, Enlai.
No, I must get back to Xibaipo.
Finish eating first
Very well.
Mr. Chairman,
the cook is Xiao Yan's old lad
He wants to see you
Of course
Thank you, sir.
Hurry.
His name is Guo Bencai. He's from my hometown.
Hello, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Kwok, you're a good cook.
It's worth everything to cook for you
Have a smoke
Thank you, sir.
Why...
It's your cigarette, I want to keep it.
Take this.
I can't.
Take it.
Thanks
Sir, this is Liu Congwen, the mess officer in the military zone.
Hello, sir.
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Zhou.
Hello. Mr Kwok.
Hello.
Mr. Chairman, any special requests for your meals?
We'II do the best we can.
I don't need much.
Make sure we put in chili.
I prepared for you already.
It'd be perfect
if I can have stewed meat twice a month.
Big fish in Chengnanzhuang
In a bungalow between 2 apricot trees near the mountains in the northern part of the village
Per your request,
field operation units
in Nanjing, Shanghai and Hong Kong have been removed.
Zhang Lan is stuck in Shanghai. Keep him under tabs.
Yes, sir
Li Jishen is in Hong Kong
He's not on our turf. Just keep an eye on him.
Yes, sir
As for Feng Yuxiang,
he's getting tight with the CPC.
He may defect
If necessary,
I'll tidy things up a bit
These are prestigious men
If you're sloppy,
public opinion overseas will backfire on us
I understand
Mao's location is confirmed?
Chengnanzhuang in Baoding.
He won't get away this time.
Remember, this is extremely important.
Confirm target, roger
Lao Guo, where are you going? This way.
Back to the kitchen. Chairman Mao's food is on the stove
Chairman?
He took some sleeping pills and went to sleep.
Wake him up. Enemy planes will be here soon.
Tiger, get a stretcher.
Yes
Wake up, sir. Enemy planes are coming.
They haven't dropped a bomb.
Then it'll be too late.
Let's go, sir
Calm down.
Cigarette.
Do that later.
Commander Nie.
Move Mr. Chairman to the bomb shelter on the stretcher
Yes, sir
Even if they start bombing,
that doesn't mean they'll hit me
I'm responsible for the Party
I'm very lucky.
Hurry.
Hurry.
Hurry.
Hurry.
Hurry.
Hello...
Well?
Still can't get through.
Keep trying.
Yes, sir
Telegram, sir.
Massive bombings, casualties unknown.
The food was still on the stove
when the bombing started.
Lao Guo said you have not eaten breakfast
He ran back to the kitchen
Telegram, Mr. Zhou
Mr. Chairman,
we have very positive response for the May 1 slogan.
The Parties have all signed their names.
Already?
What a surprise.
The situation is becoming clear
The CDL and the Revolutionary Committee are on our side.
Chiang is now completely isolated.
Everything will fall into place
It's time to call for a new CPPCC.
Jishen, Mao wrote you personally.
What's your concern?
Back in Fujian, we agreed to oppose Chiang.
But they changed their minds
Fujian was a few years ago.
That was Bo Gu, not Mao.
I'm not holding a grudge.
I don't need another fall
Chiang toyed with us for decades
No doubt the CPC has better credibility,
but what if...
We just set up a new Party.
As the Chairman of Revolutionary Committee of the KMT,
I must do my best
for the future of the Party
Issue a separate declaration
to oppose Chiang
Reiterate our opposition against one-party autocracy.
That'll be our response to the CPC.
Nowhere inside the Shanhai Pass
is a suitable venue for the new consultative meeting,
except Harbin
It's far away,
but at least it's a big city.
Feng Yuxiang will be home this month
He'll go directly to the Northeast.
Then let's settle for Harbin.
To build a new government for the whole country
without a decent big city,
it's just not adequate
Goods are scarce. Commodities entered the black market.
Everyone is buying
and selling short
The top brass in the military and political circles
are behind these activities.
Those profiteers
defy government orders.
Mr. Weng can't hold the fort much longer.
What's your solution?
I don't want your complaints.
I want a solution.
As the financial center in the Far East,
Shanghai is the key.
If we can stabilize the market in Shanghai,
the rest of the country will fall in line.
I must go to Shanghai.
Master Chiang, on behalf of Shanghai,
we're hosting a banquet for you at the Jinjiang Hotel.
I'll pick you up later
Tell everyone on the Special Commando Unit
to meet in my office in half an hour,
including you
In preparing for the new CPPCC,
the CPC is open for suggestions.
They don't intend to run the whole show.
They do things differently from the Nanjing government
What about Zhang Lan?
He's always for building the state via CPPCC
They already have a well thought-out plan
to escort you and my mother up north.
Mao invited you and Li Jishen up north
to discuss re-opening the CPPCC.
When is Li Jishen leaving?
Don't know yet
What's your answer?
I have decided
to stay put
But...
Let Shen Junru liaise with the CPC on behalf of the CDL
When are you leaving?
I'm too old and sick.
Besides, Chiang won't let me go that easily.
How can you not show for something this important?
I'm putting Shen Junru in charge.
I am Chinese.
Is that right, Father?
One stroke is missing.
Isn't this pretty, Uncle Mao?
Yes, but you can't eat everything.
Mr. Chairman, it's time for the meeting.
Let's go back
Will you carry me, Uncle Mao?
Carry me, Father.
Will you carry me, Uncle Mao? Father
Liya, do you want me to carry you?
Yes.
Let's go.
Any news, Enlai?
Chiang's economic reform is a deadlock.
Chiang Ching-kuo personally flew to Shanghai.
But the Bund is entrenched with powerful factions.
It's a labyrinth within the KMT.
Chiang's son won't accomplish anything.
Liya, let's play piggyback.
Yes.
Let's go.
No one should doubt the Government's
determination to implement financial reforms.
In face of a national crisis,
anyone who compromises the nation's interest
is a traitor
and an enemy of the KMT
I urge the elite of the business sector
and prominent individuals of society to work with us
to restore financial order and stabilize prices
in the shortest time possible
and do your best to save our country.
Mr. Chiang
Will you be fair?
What about those offenders who have influence?
How will you handle them?
My mission in Shanghai
is to hunt tigers, not squat mosquitoes.
Mr. Chiang, can you tell us
your concrete course of action?
Tigers are easy to hunt
but I'm afraid icebergs
are hard to remove.
You are...
Du Yuesheng
Mr. Du, I'm all ears
My son Weiping has been arrested
If he broke the law, I have no complaints,
but someone else in Shanghai
is hoarding supplies
and peddling them to the black market for profits,
openly defying the law
If you choose to overlook this,
President Chiang will be very disappointed.
Please point me in the right direction, Mr. Du.
I will look into it.
Read it.
7 godowns along the Bund.
The godown on No. 36 Nanjing Road.
No 17 Avenue Joffre.
12 godowns in the South Market using the word "Jia"
Mr. Chiang,
this is the real tiger.
Who is it?
Yangtze Company owned by the Kung's.
Wire Wei Lihuang, urge him to pull back south.
With crack troops like these,
even if we lose the Northeast, we can get it back easily.
President, we wired him several times
urging him to go south,
but he ignored us.
Get my plane ready,
I'II fly out to Shenyang
Yes.
The President
What is it?
Feng Yuxiang is dead.
Chairman.
What happened to you?
You bragged about your abilities.
You bragged about Shanghai.
You bragged about the Red Army. And now?
General Feng was burned to death.
You.
This is all you can do
Think it over. You won't get away.
You'll be executed if you lose a battle.
Now something went wrong on your front.
Tell me what you should do. Speak up.
KMT secret agents did it?
According to the Russians,
General Feng was watching a film in his cabin.
The film caught on fire and ignited the cabin.
The film caught on fire? He's a general.
Why didn't he run?
What a bunch of morons.
A man is dead, the Russians need to blame someone.
The ship was out at sea and abroad.
We didn't get all the facts
General Feng became a soldier at 12.
50 years in the battlefield didn't kill him
But our invitation
to send him abroad buried him at sea
I feel so guilty
General Feng may be dead
but he left behind a legacy
to build a new, independent China.
Enlai, wire our condolences to Madame Feng
and invite her to the CPPCC.
Yes.
Mr. Chairman, it has been suggested
that the CPPCC should act for the NPC
to elect the central government
A general election is hard to come by during the war
We must consult all the other Parties on this
Let's not waste any time.
Form the coalition government first, then call the NPC,
is that it?
Precisely
They're still in a war
They can't elect their delegates
We should make allowances for that.
I'll get in touch with Shen Junru
and pass on your message.
Mr. Mao and Mr. Zhou invited you up north again
Assemble.
Hurry.
Search all the godowns, buildings, apartments and villas
in Shanghai owned by Yangtze Company and the Kung's.
Operation starts at 7 am tomorrow morning, understand?
Mr. Chairman.
Voices within the US government have indicated
they will support your replacement of Mr. Chiang.
What do you think?
Whether they support me or Chiang,
it's a cheap trick to pit Chinese against Chinese
If the US wishes to maintain diplomatic relations with the future China,
ignoring the CPC
is unrealistic.
The second question.
If Vice President Li replaced President Chiang,
will things get better?
In terms of warfare,
Bai Chongxi is quite capable.
In terms of politics,
Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi together are no match for Chiang.
You did not answer my question, sir.
Here
What are you looking at?
Jinzhou.
That's over 1,000 km away.
More definite news won't arrive until tomorrow.
It's already 10:30 and yet no sign of attack. Which division was it?
The 8th column.
You asked me 5 times already
Really?
The Battle of Jinzhou is not just over a city or a region
If we win, we can go on
If we lose, the situation gets complicated
With regards to the draft agenda of the CPPCC,
Zhang Lan and Shen Junru made minor changes
They know we're at war.
They're being very understanding.
Zhang Lan is sick.
We should postpone his trip up north
We must invite him.
But we'll let him decide
when to come.
We'll wait.
Aunt, he has full authority
to seize everything owned by the Yangtze Company
He put out word all over Shanghai looking for me
Now I finally see him.
That ought to save him some trouble.
Have you gone mad, David?
Relax. He's the Liaison Administrator, the prince.
I wouldn't dare shoot the prince.
This is very simple, cousin.
Shoot me and it's all over
With the culprit dead, you'll be famous in Shanghai.
We'll both get what we want.
Ching-kuo.
It's clearly written in the state papers.
You're needed for questioning within 10 days
or you'll be severely punished.
7 days have gone by, you decide what to do next
Yangtze Company is our family estate.
I dare you to arrest my father.
Nonsense. It's clearly your fault
Leave your father out of this
If he and Ai-ling found out about your monkey business,
they won't spare you
This is how we do business in Shanghai.
But the arrival of a Liaison Administrator changed all that
Auntie, everyone does it. That's the rule
Only a feudalistic dictator
would run a business without rules.
Who are you calling a dictator?
The government is fighting a war and soldiers are dying on the front
But the state treasury is empty and we had to borrow from the Americans.
Currency has depreciated and prices have skyrocketed.
People are running scared.
But inside your godowns,
you hoarded over 100 thousand tons of supplies
which you are unwilling to sell.
I'm a businessman, not a philanthropist
The CPC is working on land reforms and political consultation.
Even Cai Tingkai and Shen Junru have left for the Northeast.
Mao is setting up his own government.
Madame, you've always supported Father.
I bet you never expected
right here in Shanghai,
someone is undermining him,
destroying the foundation of this country.
Their fortune, apartments,
clothes, perfumes and iceboxes are like a virus
residing on the mere skeleton of this country.
They are the enemy, Father's and the state's
That's enough,
Ching-kuo.
There are no enemies here, only family.
Let's talk about family today.
I'm not in the position to say anything
He Yingqin is the Director of National Defense
Take pains to stay save. Let Chiang talk to him.
You're a better marksman than He Yingqin.
So what?
Chiang owns China now.
Even this gun has his name engraved on it
What can we do about it?
The CPC troops use this type of rifle too.
What matters is not the name on the rifle,
but the man who uses it
Holding a rifle
beats holding an empty title of Director of National Defense
If you're the President,
will the Americans back us up?
Stuart dropped a hint.
Then let's get rid of Chiang.
It's still too early to say.
Never too early to take precautions.
It's time we get started
Ching-kuo, Madam is leaving for the US tomorrow
to ask President Truman for help.
The situation in the Northeast is deteriorating quickly.
We need help from the Americans
I flew back from the Northeast
just to tell you,
at a time like this
we can't afford a fire in the backyard.
Father
If we don't punish the Kung's,
the economy in Shanghai is doomed.
I absolutely understand
The corruption of the KMT is in the bones.
It's not just the problem of the Kung's
Crackdown on corruption is a major issue
Timing and extent are crucial...
it's tough.
You lose the Party if you proceed.
You lose the country if you don't.
It's tough.
Father
Both the Party and the country are on the brink of disaster.
Alright
The matter at hand
is to move the troops up North to south of the Yangtze River
to ensure the safety there
Going after the Kung's
is meaningless now.
Zhang Lan is truly a saint of Sichuan.
He deserves it.
Without him at the CPPCC,
none of us Sichuanese
would dare to go.
The Northeast is too cold for a man his age.
He probably can't make it
If anything happens to him...
What about Beiping?
What?
Postpone the meeting till next year.
Move the venue to Beiping
It's possible.
The troops are tired after taking Shenyang.
Fu Zuoyi commands 600,000 men.
Relying on 2 divisions in the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region
to capture Beiping is impossible.
According to our intelligence
lately, Fu Zuoyi is having second thoughts.
After the failed attempt on Shijiazhuang,
he seems willing to negotiate
Send someone reliable to liaise with him.
Ok.
It'd be heavenly, if we can liberate Beiping peacefully.
Fu's daughter Dongju is a Party member.
She's perfect for the job
Yes.
In that case, I'll be the dictator for a change.
Ask the Northeast Field Army to enter the Shanhai Pass within 7 days.
Tell Lin Biao
this is an order and not a probe.
It'll take a few days to gather up the troops
and each column needs time to adjust otherwise.
Moving inside the Pass will be a problem.
The cadres don't want to make the move
and it'll take time for deployment.
The deadline on the 22nd is too tight.
Wire this back: Received order dispatched on 18th at 18:00
Will set out on the 22nd as instructed.
Details to follow Signed, Lin, Luo & Liu
You should think for yourself too.
You really want me
to hold the horsewhip for your Chairman?
Forget it, Father It was a joke.
A joke?
I personally told the American reporter.
It's not a joke.
That's because you took it to heart
Li Jishen is a founding member of the Party who opposes Chiang openly
Over these last few months,
Mao has repeatedly invited him up north.
He's been stalling him. He's bewildered by
You come to see me
with a 18-year old newspaper.
How kind of you.
The quarrel between you and the President
should stay within the Party.
Between you and the CPC,
don't forget you ordered the execution of Cai Hesen.
What are you saying?
Return to Nanjing and pick any job you want,
as long as you don't join the CPC
A promotion for a promise?
You think I'll go?
Before I came, Vice President Li told me
he would like to liaise with the CPC through you.
Any condition is negotiable,
including using the Yangtze as a partition.
Use the Yangtze as a partition
and split up China?
Tell Li Zongren
The infamy is more than he can handle.
Hello, Mr President
Commander Fu.
Our troops can pull back to Tanggu and Zhangjiakou
I can't guarantee we'll win
But we're perfectly capable of defense.
With the big picture in mind.
I intend to move 600,000 men to Jiangnan
I can be more flexible in both defense and offense
That's containing our sovereignty to the southeast.
As the old capital, Beiping has political significance.
Giving it up
is unfavorable to our government internationally
You're right. International scope is the situation.
Wait.
What is it, Father?
Who's your commanding officer?
We agreed not to discuss that
I wish to talk to them.
About what? The horsewhip?
What I'm telling you now
will determine the lives of millions.
I understand
She's so hot.
I'm sorry, May-ling.
Both the House and the Congress
have refused your request to make another speech.
But the Government will still support the General as before
with the hope that the civil war does not continue any longer in China.
President Truman and his administration is concentrating on Europe.
But the East needs a revival too.
My friend.
China should have been included in your plan.
Any loans and assistance from the US now
should be spent on security and constructive activities,
not war
You got 400 million dollars from the original loan.
That's still in existence.
We both know there's only a few million dollars left.
And it's not enough to support my husband's administration
and his life's work.
Mr. Secretary of State,
we need your additional assistance,
please.
Madam, there's nothing more we can do.
New Year is coming up.
Make this announcement at month end.
About what?
If they want me to resign, I'll resign.
You can't do that, Mr. President.
It's not my choice.
But someone within our Party wants me out.
You repeatedly rejected Mao and Zhou's invitation.
You're too arrogant.
That's an overstatement, Madame Liao.
I'm tied up at home
And I'm also busy with military affairs
Preparations for the new CPPCC are moving along and days are counting.
After decades, the KMT can't be absent
You're still hesitant about going.
You expect Mao to fly to Nanjing to invite Chiang?
We're definitely not inviting him.
He's a war criminal, a murderer.
We can't have a CPPCC without the KMT.
Jishen, Chairman Mao said
he'd wait for you in Beiping.
Chief, some landlord's compound up ahead
The wall is too high for us to climb over.
Grenades won't blow it apart. Please send for the artillery.
Flare
Flare
Commander...
we have reached Beiping city
2 pieces of good news, sir
First,
Li Jishen, Shen Yanbing and Zhang Naiqi
left 4 days ago.
They boarded the Aldan and will disembark at Dalian day after tomorrow.
And the other one?
Chiang Kai-shek resigned
Mr. Ambassador.
As China's ally,
why is the US doing nothing at a time like this?
God help those who help themselves, my friend
I think Chiang is giving Li Zongren a hard time.
He knows Li wants to negotiate, so he brought it up first.
He doesn't want Li to get the credit
and he wants to give us a hard time.
He already stepped down, but he had to pull a stunt like this.
After this,
it would be tough for Li to talk to us.
The CDL and the other Parties
have yet to make a stand, they're waiting to see.
In my opinion,
deep down
they want us to talk.
Li Zongren wants peace, we want peace,
the other Parties want peace.
We'll do the Acting President a favor
Great.
Let's give him a chance to talk,
but we decide how.
Victory bulletin...
War communique from Huaihai
According to the wire,
550,000 enemies were killed and Du Yuming was captured.
What about the New 5th and the 18th?
Gone.
The 5 major divisions were wiped out.
Chiang is finished for good.
There'll be no more fighting north of the Yangtze.
Cheers.
This is the last battle.
We stay united till tomorrow.
Internationale
will come true.
This is the last battle.
We stay united till tomorrow.
"Internationale" will come true.
Father, it's cold on the ground.
Sit down.
Ching-kuo.
You did a good job in Shanghai. I'm very pleased.
I made Chen Cheng Governor of Taiwan.
Do you know why?
Your route of retreat?
Yes, Du Yuming's men were wiped out.
I lost all the men who can fight.
We can't count on the 1 million men we captured in Jiangnan
They can barely hold their rifles
The Yangtze is lost.
You intend to evacuate to Taiwan?
You're coming too.
You think Li Zongren won't get anywhere
with the CPC over the peace negotiations?
If we can't defeat them at war,
we won't beat them at the conference table
Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi thought
the CPC will settle for using the Yangtze as a partition
They don't know Mao Zedong.
Mao will never agree to
separate governments on both sides of the Yangtze?
Would you accept if it were you?
That'd depend on the US and the USSR...
Don't make it so complicated. It doesn't matter what anyone thinks
China was split into north and south in the past
but not today.
Who would want to be blamed for it?
Definitely not me
Mr. Zhang Lan
Right now, in your opinion,
will the CPC accept the Government's plea for peace?
Impossible.
Why is that?
If Chiang never gives up his so-called constitution,
The CPC will not recognize it
and neither will the people.
You know Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai very well.
Are they local revolutionaries
or mere agents working for international communist intelligence bureau?
What kind of question is that?
I want to know your view.
My view is that the CPC catered for the people
which explains their achievements today.
Achievements?
Yes, achievements.
Dear Zuoyi
You and I have come a long way.
Given the circumstances, you took matters into your own hands.
There's nothing I can do about that, but I have one request.
I will send planes to Beiping tomorrow
to airlift officers of the 13th Army ranked Major or above
and essential weaponry
On account of our long standing friendship, please help me out.
Chiang Chung-cheng.
Beiping fell Fu Zuoyi surrendered.
The CPC is moving in on the Yangtze and Nanjing.
With regards to my plea for peace,
the CPC accepted it
but raised 8 very harsh conditions.
Madame, if you speak on behalf of the Government,
Mao and Zhou may trust me.
As you know, Mr. Acting President,
I washed my hands in politics since the onset of the civil war.
There are rumors in the newspapers about me coming out of retirement.
The Trust had to issue a denial.
Madame.
Dr. Sun founded the KMT.
You can't sit back and
watch it go to ruin.
Don't forget, you may be the Acting President,
but Chiang Kai-shek is still the Party Chairman.
Looks like the Acting President is having a hard time.
Chiang stepped down in name only
He still has control of everything.
Li Zongren does not have enough authority.
He's only a puppet
Nothing will come out of the negotiation.
No wonder you turned him down
I don't want to go to Beiping
because Dr. Sun died there. Too many memories.
Master Zhang, you're a veteran of the United League
and Zhu De's mentor
Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu have great respect for you.
The Acting President issued a declaration for peace negotiation
You're the most suitable person to mediate.
If the CPC brought up 8 conditions,
go ahead and talk to them.
If Mao wants to talk,
he wouldn't raise these harsh conditions.
There should be room to negotiate in a negotiation.
That's why the Acting President sent me to haggle with them
To mediate.
As you know, the Government clamped down on the CDL.
It is now an illegal organization
I'm now in the same party as the Communists.
Please don't be upset, sir.
Mr Chiang issued that order,
not the Acting President.
I side with the revolutionary.
I won't haggle for the enemy
Sir.
See them out
A partitioned rule? China is not Korea.
The Yangtze is not the 38th Parallel.
Wire the General Front Committee.
Their war plan has been approved
The central government advises to move the plan up to end of April
Go
Hurry Are you ok?
Don't push
Lin Biao is still so skinny.
Eating 1 million Nationalist soldiers
didn't even make him fat
Comrades
On behalf of the Secretariat of the Central Politburo, I hereby announce
the commencement of the second meeting
of the 7th CPC Central Committee.
What should we do about Zhang Lan?
He'd rather die than go to Taiwan.
He's trouble to us if he stays.
Give him what he wants
Sir.
Get rid of Zhang Lan.
He's a man of influence, sir
The more reason to get rid of him.
I see
Openly or privately?
How can you do this openly?
Like I said, don't let me see him alive.
And no body if he's dead.
Don't make a mess.
I understand
Go on.
Take care
Stop
Get out.
Are you Zhang Lan?
Who are you?
What do you want?
Deputy Chief Yan Jinwen of the Shanghai Inspectorate
On behalf of the CPC, I will get you out
Trust me.
Brother Yan.
Morning, you're on duty?
Security has been tightened lately
Where are you going?
On Inspectorate business.
Mixing pleasure with business. My father is in the car.
Go ahead, do what you have to
No need, run along
Bye.
Let them through
Where are you taking us?
Up north
Enlai, where's the Chairman?
Went to get smokes.
Not a shop is open in two blocks.
Chengjun, you're the county committee secretary.
This can't go on.
After entering the city, rumor has it
capitalists and businessmen are exploiters
and we should punish them.
They're so scared no one is open for business.
This is not a small matter.
Revolution is our forte
but not economics.
Can't even get smokes without the merchants,
let alone market prosperity.
We need the capitalists back.
At this stage, we can't eliminate them yet.
Production must be handled with care.
If anything goes wrong,
it'll be worse than losing a battle.
We must know our limits
We must learn from scratch.
The gist of political consultation
involves capitalists and democracy activists.
We invite them to help run the country,
not to eliminate them.
We must be very clear on this: If we destroy them
and we can't run production on our own,
factories will close down and worker will lose their jobs.
We'll be smashing our own rice bowls.
We barely got our hands on them, don't smash them.
Comrades, we ask two things of you.
Keep your backs straight and your voices up, understand?
Yes.
Chairman Mao
General Fu, you flatter me.
I promised to hold your horsewhip if I lose.
Today, I'll hold the door for you.
You did not lose The loser is in Nanjing.
Don't hold the door for me
Help me open the door for a new China.
Salute
Sir.
I'm with the 28th Army
I'm here with the Tashan troops
to join the dress parade.
On behalf of
soldiers of the Red Army, dead or alive,
I salute you, Chairman Mao.
Forward...
Forward...
Forward...
Long live Chairman Mao
Are these the 100,000 used guns
you mentioned in Chongqing three years ago?
The CPC has come a long way
Long live Chairman Mao
Long live Commander Zhu
Long live Chairman Mao
Long live Commander Zhu
Long live Chairman Mao
Since they're crossing the Yangtze River anyway,
what the hell is the point of negotiation?
To surrender before the fight begins? I'm a soldier, I won't do it.
The CPC knew you're different from Chiang.
Mao knows you enjoy being in the army.
He personally told me you might continue to command the troops
up to as many as 400,000
Nonsense. I'm already the Minister of National Defense.
Zongren, we don't get along with Chiang.
That's our internal business.
It's not up to the Communists to jack us around.
What's the use of saying that now?
What are you suggesting then?
Let's wait for word from Xikou.
300,000 courageous PLA
crossed the Yangtze River on the 21 st.
The campaign started at midnight on the 20th.
Didn't even hold the defense line for one day.
He Yingqin is retreating.
They say to Guangzhou.
Shall we go with them?
I have to look after the interests of the United States
I should stay here in Nanjing.
I heard the Soviet embassy
had relocated to Guangzhou with the Government.
Morning, Madam. Morning
The sound of gunfire went on all night. It finally stopped.
Madam, you didn't sleep well.
I'll go for a walk.
Have you decided to leave?
Really?
Hello, Chairman Mao.
Hello, Chairman Mao.
Hello Jishen.
Mr. Zhou. This way, please.
Chairman, Zhang Lan is here.
Mr. Mao, you flatter me
Not at all.
Master Zhang, how are you? Mr Zhou
Welcome, please come this way.
Hello, Master Zhang.
Calling the CPPCC to establish a new people's Government,
I recommend you both for Vice Presidents.
I'd like to hear your opinion.
I'll go along with your arrangement.
You have something to say?
Is this your idea?
The Central Committee's idea
I killed members of your party.
That was then, this is now.
All roads lead to Rome.
We can't change history.
Nobody's perfect.
A personal matter, no matter how important, is a minor issue.
A state matter, no matter how trivial, is a major issue, For the new state,
be our Vice President on behalf of the Revolutionary Committee.
This is a state matter
Forget the past.
The CPC is willing to work with you to lead this country.
Let's help each other, as we're in the same boat now
Together, we'll make history.
As you wish.
I'll do my best for China.
We strongly urge our comrades in China
to set up their own government soon
The USSR will, at the earliest time possible,
set up diplomatic relations with the new regime.
That's wonderful.
The frantic bombing of Shanghai by the KMT is causing chaos.
I'm worried about Madam Sun's safety.
She's our most faithful friend when we were in dire straits
The new CPPCC is about to commence.
It won't be complete without her.
Men like us
won't know how to talk to her.
Send a female comrade to escort her here.
Enlai, we'II burden Yingchao with the task
Good idea.
Madam Zhou to escort Madam Sun.
I'll tell her right away.
To form a coalition government without you
is something the Party will never agree to.
Neither would the rest of the country
I'm only the vanguard
If I failed to convince you, Enlai would be next
and then Chairman Mao himself.
If we all failed to convince you,
we'd put this on the agenda of the CPPCC,
vote on it and send a delegation.
You Communists
won't stop until you get what you want.
What do you think of this house?
Not bad, spacious and bright.
Mayor Chen Yi said he'd giving it to you
as a permanent site for the youth center
of your China Welfare Fund.
The children can play in here every day.
That's wonderful.
Madam Sun
Times have changed, Zedong. You mustn't do that.
Only for Madam Sun.
Thanks for the invitation and Yingchao's company.
Now the Party can work with all delegates
to build a new state,
I must thank your help and support.
You have been a great help to the country and its people
and a benefactor of our Party.
Fellow delegates,
the yellow flag pole in the center of figure No 1 represents the Yellow River.
It stands out. Those in favor, please raise your hands.
Good. It's unilateral.
I object.
From an artistic perspective,
No. 32 is much better.
Mr. Tian is an artist
who's partial to the 5 stars.
The person who submitted this design
is an ordinary clerk from Shanghai
It was disqualified in the first round, but I want to bring it up again.
Because this design
is full of emotions.
I object to the version of the 4 stars representing the 4 classes.
I prefer the Yellow River pattern.
Simple and sharp.
How many in favor of the 5-star flag?
Delegate Xu Beihong suggests
we use "March of the Volunteers" as the national anthem
Let's hear your comments
The melody is good, but we need to change the lyrics.
This is a new China.
The original lyrics are outdated.
Mr. Tian Han, you're the lyricist.
What's your opinion?
I should refrain from commenting. I'll listen to the others.
I agree we should change the lyrics
We can't sing it every day,
especially this line:
its greatest peril."
It won't work
I disagree, "La Marseillaise" of France
is tragic but has been handed down till now
That's France, not China
The lyrics of the song remind us
not to forget the past. I agree
New China needs a new song for its new outlook.
Why use a song from an old movie?
What about you, Mr. Li?
was written for the war
I sang it before. It's inspirational and gets my blood boiling.
become our new Great Wall".
We must remember history.
No need to change the lyrics.
Well said.
Agree. I have a good sense for danger too
The Chairman wishes to keep the original lyrics.
What about you? You kept raising your hand.
They took the words out of my mouth I have no comment.
Let me say just one thing.
To be vigilant in peace time is what a mature nation should do
We'll let Mr. Tian Han decide
Then let's keep the lyrics.
Chairman Mao, fellow delegates.
Are you ready?
Look over here, ready.
This is a women's delegation.
Chairman, everyone is talking about the pattern on the national flag.
What do you think?
I like the Yellow River.
I disagree.
Can you fix the negative? Yes.
Take out the person next to me.
There are over 10 people next to you.
I mean the man who jammed in
Alright. Thank you
What's your reason?
Chairman, adding a pole to the middle
gives the impression of splitting up the country.
Is that the right interpretation?
Can't be that serious. Most people prefer this one
Gong Peng, what do you think?
We like No 32
Placing five stars in the left corner
with four small stars surrounding
and their tips pointing at the big star It looks pretty.
Chairman, the big star in the middle represents the Party
while the small ones represent the 4 classes
The symbolism is correct.
Looking at this flag makes one feel enthusiastic.
Enthusiastic?
I feel excited when I look at the flag.
Madam Sun likes this design too.
You have been abroad, your opinion should count
Please tell us what you think.
The five stars design is a good representation of China's situation.
Under the leadership of the CPC,
all the classes are united to build a new China
The color is sharp, solemn and grand.
The truth is, China is united. Well said.
We're united now and we'll always be in the future.
Is the air raid on Beiping feasible?
The Chairman wants feedback from the Air Force.
The flying radius is too big.
The planes must re-tank somewhere
or they won't make it back.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has liaised with the Americans in Korea
You can rest assured.
But the CPC has its air force now.
The Chairman only wants to know
if the air raid is feasible. That's all.
Despite the difficulties, as long as he issues the order,
we'll get it done.
Fellow delegates,
the CPPCC that the whole country is looking forward to
will now commence.
The new CPPCC
will commence on a brand new foundation
It represents the Chinese people
and has the people's faith and support
Therefore, the CPPCC hereby announces
its right to call this meeting
Fellow delegates,
we have a consensus
that our work here
will go down in history.
It proves that China, which accounts for 1/4 of the world's population,
is finally on her feet
The destiny of China is in the hands of her people
China will rise like the sun in the east.
Its radiance will illuminate the land
and cleanse the filth and mire left behind by the reactionary government.
Heal the wounds of war and build a brand new
and powerful People's Republic of China.
Long live the People's Republic of China.
Long live the Coalition Government.
Long live the unity of the people
According to Commander Zhou,
the planes are in Class A status.
They're ready to bombard Beiping any time.
But the US has turned down our request to refuel in Pusan.
What does that mean?
They can't come back after takeoff.
What time is Mao's founding ceremony?
3pm at Tiananmen Square.
It's fate. The KMT is ruined with our own hands
Cancel the mission
Yes, sir
The People's Republic of China and
the Central People's Government
have been established today

For thousands of years China was a first class world power.
Why has China declined
to such a degree?
Because we, the Chinese people, have been asleep.
Down with the military government!
No disarming! No surrender!
Protect the Shanghai worker's movement!
Down with the warlords!
Down with the military government!
No disarming! No surrender!
Protect the Shanghai worker's movement!
Down with the warlords!
Down with the military government!
No disarming! No surrender!
Protect the Shanghai worker's movement!
Down with the warlords!
Down with the military government!
No disarming! No surrender!
Move! This is a peaceful demonstration!
What are you doing?
Why would you shoot at us?
This is a peaceful demonstration!
Ready,
fire!
Director Zhou!
Si Li!
Am I, Zhou Enlai, being the target?
No way.
The situation is not safe.
My brother said your safety must be guaranteed.
This way.
Where is Mr. Du?
He has been waiting a long time for you inside.
I'm three minutes early.
The worker's militia was sent by the trade association.
Today the workers have guns.
Tomorrow the peasants will want guns too.
What good is the army?
The worker's uprising
overthrew the Beiyang government in Shanghai
and should be credited for the revolution!
I am a soldier
and it is my duty to obey commands.
Was the command from Wang Jingwei?
No.
Then from whom?
I will say it one more time.
Apologize to us
and return the worker's militia's guns.
These are our two basic conditions.
This speech,
I'm afraid, shouldn't come from me.
Then who on earth should it come from?
Some things must be stated clearly!
You can't become president of the Shangai Labor Union anymore.
Come and work for me
and I'll give you a few bars of gold every month
to feed your family.
You should know well
what kind of man I am.
I do. I do know.
You got rid of the Beiyang government
in Shanghai with just a few battered rifles.
Your whole life is ahead of you and your potential is limitless.
Please wait.
This is what you get for harboring the worker's militia!
Wang Shouhua,
I have the utmost respect for you.
So please, you must take this cup of wine.
First, a toast to your good self.
Second, a toast to your faith.
Third, a toast to your perseverance.
Chop them up!
You commie! Write something now!
I asked you to write something!
I, Zhou Enlai, am never leery of my friends.
Si Lie...
You can stop now; it's not too late.
I have no authority or influence here.
Back when you sent your brother to the Huangpu Military Academy,
we recited Dr. Sun Yat-sen's admonition together.
Do you remember?
The Three Principles of the People.
"Our aim shall be:
To found a free land,
World peace, be our stand.
Lead on, comrades,
Vanguards ye are.
Hold fast your aim,
By sun and star."
You wept then.
But less than 3 years later
you've turned your back on your beliefs.
Toppling the foreign powers in China,
uniting the entire country,
and rebuilding the republic.
These are the lifelong ideals of Dr. Sun.
But you've turned your gun on your brother
before the Northern Expedition has even finished.
That was not my intention at all.
I've told you. I am a soldier
and I follow orders.
Orders from whom?
The Nationalist Government in Wuhan,
the Beiyang Government in Beiping
or the Nanjing Military Government Chiang Kai-shek wants to found?
Three governments in one country
and you say the country's not splitting?
You still say it's not a betrayal to Dr. Sun?
Chairman Wang Jingwei and General Secretary Chen Duxiu
issued a joint statement calling for strength, unity, and cooperation.
Si Lie,
you're being used as cannon fodder by careerists!
When the circumstances change,
have you thought about how things will end for you?
Please enlighten me, Mr. Zhou.
I have served with Commander-in-Chief Chiang for several years.
I know a thing or two about him.
When Wuhan began to bring those responsible to account,
would he have helped you escape?
Mr. Zhou,
there was no way around
offending you today.
When I see you again,
I will offer you my sincerest apology.
Dismissed!
Thank you for your advice.
Sir.
"Take down the military dictatorship.
"Chiang Kai-shek Orders to Dismiss the Political Departments in the Armies.
"Revolution has yet to succeed; Comrades must still exert themselves."
Commander-in-Chief, express telegram from Beijing.
Read it
Zhang Zuolin arrested Li Dazhao in the Russian Embassy
and he's asking what should be done about him.
Well, he certainly knows how to shift responsibility
by asking my opinion.
What did he say?
"Li Dazhao
is the leader of the Northern Branch of KMT.
He lives in the capital in secret
and colludes with foreigners.
He's now caught in the act.
What should be done with him?"
Send Zhang a telegram and say
the Party is being purged
and the suspect is no longer a member of the Nationalist Party.
As his case relates to foreign affairs,
it's recommended he be tried soon
and then executed
to avoid further ado.
If we keep this up,
the revolution will be wiped out
and the Communist Party will be destroyed.
We have to show our cards
and voice the most rigorous protest.
I ought to write articles
and expose the true colors of that bastard Chiang Kai-shek.
Soldier boy...
New here?
You look like a baby.
I'm clearly older than you.
I was born in the Year of the Goat.
So was I.
Which month?
December.
I'm August.
Call me big brother.
Like hell I will.
What are you talking about?
This would be suicidal.
Wang Jingwei doesn't know what to do.
Wuhan
has a storm on the horizon.
Let us hear Comrade Chen Duxiu's opinion.
The forces amassed by the workers and peasants over the years
were slaughtered by more than half on a single day.
As the Party's general secretary, I feel the most pain.
The Communist Party and the Nationalist Party had an agreement
to form a united front
in the revolution together.
But Chiang Kai-shek
now uses the weapons supplied by the Comintern
to slaughter us.
We have to arm ourselves
and fight this aggression.
Indeed we must fight.
Our blood must not be shed in vain.
Confronting the enemy head on
puts us at a disadvantage.
But giving them free reign
is out of the question.
We have only one option:
Hand over our weapons immediately.
Our weapons?
Why give them our weapons?
Be quiet!
Why give them our weapons?
Because we don't have a lot of guns to hand over in the first place.
Since we hardly have any guns already,
what's the harm in handing them all over?
Once we give them up
we become like sheep
that anyone could slaughter at will.
Wang Jingwei and his Wuhan government
are sympathetic to communists
and the revolution.
If all the armed workers and peasants
in this country
handed over all their weapons,
Chiang Kai-shek would have no excuse to harm us
and Wang Jingwei would try his best to help us.
China faces a crisis
and our hope should continue to rest in...
continue to rest in...
Wang Jingwei now wants to get in bed with Chiang Kai-shek
and this is their conspiracy!
We can't trust them!
What happened?
Comrade Li Dazhao
was murdered
by warlords.
Not a single rifle can be surrendered.
If we do, our fate as communists
will be the same as Li Dazhao!
Zedong, it's not the turn of the Hu'nan representatives to speak!
Can we rely on the Wang Jingwei government?
No, we can't!
And it would be suicide for us to hand over our guns!
We have only one way to go
and that is armed struggle!
We once criticized Sun Yat-sen for engaging exclusively in armed campaigns.
But what about us?
We reach for the pen and ignore the rifle.
And in the end we will only usher in a massacre.
Yes.
You are just being an alarmist!
Chen Duxiu, you and Mr. Li walked out in front of the revolution
and now you want to surrender our arms. Why?
I will do it to protect the working class
and grow the revolutionary forces.
This is just some contrived measure!
How many workers are there in China?
Very few.
Our country is mainly comprised of peasants.
Such a backwards class of people.
Once the land issues are solved
and the peasants are armed,
they become the capital for our revolution
as well as our largest force.
Do you understand any of this?
Right now I don't,
but I will in the future.
Get out!
How dare you distort Marxism?
Who do you think you are?
Zedong!
Mao, get out now!
Get out!
Comrade Wang Shouhua,
today is the 49th day since you
and your 300 comrades died on April 12.
I hereby pledge
that for the realization of our glorious common ideal
to found a new China,
I, Zhou Enlai, will fight for the rest of my life
and stay devoted
till my heart ceases to beat.
You were elected a member of the Political Bureau at the 5th CPC National Congress.
The Congress decided to
suspend the Military Department
and organize the Central Military Commission
with you as the general secretary.
Mao Zedong made a good point.
What did he say?
He spoke the truth.
He was in charge of mobilizing peasants in Guangzhou
and I didn't know
he had such a unique opinion on armed struggles.
He wrote "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement In Hunan"
and has a deep understanding of China's situation.
We also need to maintain our path of urban struggles.
Fighting with two fists
is the only way to overwhelm the enemy.
Yingchao,
pack up.
We are going to Wuhan.
Wuhan?
You came to see me as soon as you reached Wuhan.
Do you have an emergency?
I read your speech
and really wanted to speak with you.
We should smokeless
and learn more.
Right now the Party needs to hear your voice.
I have already been driven out
and no one is willing to listen to me anymore.
But I am a communist and I'm willing to listen.
See, am I not here for you already?
Cigarettes are such a wonderful thing.
It would be terrible to not know how to smoke them.
But once you know how,
they make you feel like an immortal.
They are just like a weapon.
They bring hope in good hands
and disaster in bad.
April 12 was a bloody lesson.
Almost all the armed forces in Shanghai were lost
and I am responsible.
In Sichuan,
He'nan,
Hubei and Guangdong,
they are still purging the communists.
This is because our power is still being weakened.
We should have no more illusions.
If we still want to continue our revolution
we have to create an army with revolutionary faith.
But now is the low tide of the revolution.
Don't lose heart.
We have millions of troops.
Can't you see them?
From where?
Peasants.
China has four hundred million peasants.
For generations
they have been bullied by the landlords and the rich
and have suffered a great deal.
They are like dry kindling covering the ground.
All it takes is a spark
and there will be a devouring fire.
Few peasant uprisings have succeeded
throughout history.
You and your comrades who have studied overseas,
praise the example set by the French Revolution
and the method of urban riots.
The working class is the main body of the revolution.
This is the general view of Marx, right?
I think China is different.
We may lack the experience
but we don't lack the courage to try.
Starting from where?
From zero, of course.
Find people if we have no one, and buy guns if we have no guns.
I'll go persuade the army.
I'll mobilize the peasants.
Last year in the Zhongshan Incident,
we stood together.
Now we stand together once more.
If what we're experiencing now is a failure,
then we communists...
We will continue to rise again and again.
Too wet.
Feng Yuxiang...
Is he going to lobby for Chiang?
I'm worried they have made a secret agreement.
The trouble is not Feng
but the communists.
Are you concerned they may start a rebellion?
"Cable from the Comintern."
Look at this. This was just intercepted.
You are right.
Ye Jianying,
can you pinpoint the information's source?
Yes.
Wang Jingwei and his men intercepted a cable
from the Comintern giving permission to Communists to begin an armed struggle.
Chiang slaughters us
and Wang Jingwei wants to join.
Then let's fight!
We can't fight them head on. We must save our strength.
Those comrades whose identities have been exposed
must leave Wuhan immediately.
Ye Ting,
lead the 11th Army to leave the city
and head east to Jiujiang.
Yes, sir.
Actually,
there is still one person we can win over.
You mean Zhang Fakui?
He only sympathizes with us verbally,
but his heart lies on Wang Jingwei's side.
I was referring to the commander of the 20th Army,
He Long.
General,
you run into a problem?
Your eyes gave it away.
Yeah.
I ran into a few.
There are still two we are facing.
Who are they?
Ye Ting...
His troops have the nickname of
the "Iron Army."
I met him once.
He is a hero.
Miss,
the true hero
is right in front of you.
All right. All right.
Who is the other problem?
He Long...
Unlike us, he didn't graduate from Huangpu.
In western Hu'nan he has built an army with two kitchen knives.
He began his Northern Expedition alone
and handed the Beiyang army a string of defeats.
Commander He,
in addition to this silver
and the post of Wuhan Garrison Commander,
we also offer what any officer would want the most.
You can promise Ye Ting's post to He Long,
and let them battle it out like two animals in a cage.
Then He Long will offer to come work for you.
Two birds with one stone.
Good.
Thanks.
The chips Mr. Chiang has offered
are expensive indeed.
What I advocate the most
is a full arsenal.
Then, please make your decision, Commander He.
I am right here for you to arrest.
I, He Long, may be illiterate.
But regarding which friend is worth having
and which is a scoundrel,
I can tell the difference.
So are we communists.
Maybe not.
Multiple times I offered to join you
but you turned me away.
Who turned you away?
Zhang Guotao!
This man is extremely arrogant
and has labelled me a bandit.
Am I a bandit?
I'm a soldier!
He has a good point.
You are always yelling to fight and to kill.
Fight?
Would you sit back with your arms folded
while the poor are bullied?
If you turn a blind eye
when they are bullied, you are an accomplice.
You fight for others' justice
but you can save only a few at most.
We communists want to fight for everyone's justice
and change millions of our people's lives.
That's exactly right.
I would not embark on
that evil ship with Chiang.
As for the gifts,
I will take care of them.
It's a shame we don't have
the Hanyang Arsenal.
Otherwise we'd have all the guns
and cannons we could want.
We would kick those bastards' asses
so they would cry for their mothers.
Chiang and Wang have split with the communists
and the world now sees communists as a threat.
In such a critical moment, Commander He knows so clearly what is right.
You are the kind of friend I must have.
A friend like you
is also what I need.
Anything else?
The Mosin-Nagans...
I can't get those.
That's what the Red Russians gave the Cantonese.
We would lose our heads
if we smuggled those out.
Have you served in the army?
I served for a few days.
I want all these guns.
I don't accept Canton Bank notes.
You have to pay in silver dollars.
That's not enough.
Here, take this.
That can be enough.
As a token of our friendship.
Also deliver the goods to Manager Luo.
Manager Luo you say.
Do you mean Luo Ronghuan?
Correct.
Then I know what you're doing.
You can keep the money
as well as the guns.
You are doing something big.
I'm keeping this watch
as the bond between us.
You are a hero
and I admire you.
The Nationalist Government is willing to accommodate you with the utmost sincerity.
United we stand. Divided we fall.
The Nationalist Government reaffirms
that any force attempting to thwart the Northern Expedition revolution will be...
Both Chiang and Wang were students of Dr. Sun Yat-sen.
Nobody expected they would betray the revolution one after the other.
This has had a chilling effect.
We will not give up.
The communists will remember forever
our intentions to follow Dr. Sun's revolutionary path.
I hope you can maintain this youthful zeal forever.
China's future
depends on you.
Madam,
I am here to say goodbye to you.
Where are you going?
Jiangxi
and then Guangdong.
To rekindle the spark of the revolution,
we must organize our own troops.
If it's necessary,
feel free to use my name
so that more people will support you.
No,
support us.
Fakui,
the communists see me as the last Emperor Shizong of Later Zhou.
And you as Zhao Kuangyin, his trusted general who robbed him of the empire.
Chairman Wang is fond of a joke.
Military men don't talk about politics.
All the communist soldiers are under your command.
That Ye Ting...
When the conditions are right there will be a coup
and the Nationalist Government's Chairmanship
will be yours sooner or later.
Chairman Wang,
it's not appropriate for you to say so.
I am not that kind of man.
As for how faithful I am to the Nationalist's Government,
it is there for all to see.
Then send a telegram
calling Ye Ting onto Lushan Mountain and let us confront him.
If he truly dares to rebel,
I will drown him with my own hands.
We can call him to the mountain for a military conference.
Then, that commander from the 20th Army...
He Long is not a communist.
Forget about it if there are real difficulties.
Don't underestimate the skill of sewing.
Sometimes
it's more important than firing a gun.
All finished.
Let me see.
Who taught you this?
Lady!
Lady! Who taught you this, Lady?
My morn did when I was little.
So you are a little girl!
A little skill never hurts anybody.
Haven't you heard of such a saying?
Watch me!
So you mean
this Lushan Conference is some kind of a trick?
Wang Jingwei wouldn't dare to seize your military power so openly
for fear it will cause a mutiny.
The Lushan Conference is just a ruse.
Once you leave your troops and go up the hill,
you'll become like teethless tigers
and you'll be bullied like sick cats.
Some kind of ambush.
I don't think it would be easy
to pull out my teeth, huh?
Here, try some.
Hey Boatsman,
nice congee.
Comrade Ye Ting taught me well.
You're not too bad at flattery either.
He really taught me well.
Su Yu!
Yes, sir.
Come,
have some congee.
Thank you.
At this point we can't return to Wuhan,
and if we head east
we'll be forced to confront Chiang Kai-shek head-on.
It is not wise for our troops to stay in Jiujiang.
Now at this crucial moment
this Zhang Fakui has become the reactionaries' lackey.
What we do next will not be easy.
What are you talking about?
Oh I apologize.
We are accustomed to speaking Cantonese among ourselves.
We're talking about where the army will be going.
Where then?
To Nanchang.
The Central Committee has decided
to stage an uprising in Nanchang.
The enemy has only 6,000 troops in Nanchang
and our 11th Army and 20th Army
together command a total of 20,000 troops.
We hold an absolute advantage.
Nanchang
has Chiang Kai-shek to the east,
Wang Jingwei to the west
and Zhang Fakui to the north.
All three are at war with one another
and none of them will send in troops
once we begin to act.
Besides,
in Nanchang City
we still have a Zhu De.
Zhu De?
Is he the guy who went to Berlin looking for the Communist Party?
I don't need to go that far.
I am right here looking for the Party.
After the uprising,
I will sponsor you to become a Party member.
Why don't I take this job?
You need a sponsor to join the Party?
This is a provision of the Party's Constitution.
All right.
Regardless of who my sponsor is,
I request
to be stationed on the frontlines.
Comrades,
Nanchang is only the beginning.
Our goal is to fight all the way back to Guangzhou,
assemble our forces,
and launch a new Northern Expedition
to unify China.
Commander Ye, Report.
I am the Colonel for the Nanchang City Garrison,
Chen Feng.
If I may enquire, sir.
Speak.
What, may I ask, is the purpose of your troops' coming to Nanchang City?
To head east to face Chiang Kai-shek.
Commander Ye, Report.
Our troops have not received any command.
This is the command.
As my job requires...
Attention!
Welcome the "Iron Army" of the Northern Expedition to enter the city!
Welcome the "Iron Army" of the Northern Expedition to enter the city!
Wang Jingwei's telegram to purge the communists
indicates he is on our side.
But some generals support him as China's leader.
We must be cautious.
He will not become someone significant.
The ones I really worry about are Ye Ting,
He Long
and Zhou Enlai.
Right now these three
can't bring too much chaos.
There are many competent men
surrounding Zhou Enlai.
You must be careful.
I understand.
By the way.
Have the gifts for Miss Mei-ling
been prepared?
They have all been sent to Shanghai.
Well, Miss Mei-ling
prefers plane trees
and wants Nanjing
to be full of them.
I have arranged people to implement your gorgeous plan.
Also,
the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Consortium
must be brought into the fold.
Our success relies 30% on military and 70% on the economy.
The country will be at peace
as long those old guys are fed well.
Yes, sir.
With this
we can change the colors of the whole world.
Luo Ronghuan,
don't you think so?
Enlai!
You treated me to wine in Berlin
and now I bring you a jar of liquor from your hometown.
How many people do you have under your control?
A few hundred, I guess.
During the uprising
I need you to eliminate one regiment.
Only one regiment?
We could take on an entire division easily.
I do have some conditions I would like to address.
Say it.
When I joined the Party
all of my money went to Party dues
and I need funds to finance this mission.
Tell me how you will use the money.
Don't worry about that.
You will know when the time comes.
Waiter! Four bowls of rice noodles.
Coming!
My... My legs are almost broken.
Here are your rice noodles.
Hurry up!
Coming!
Hurry up!
Enjoy.
Hey! Come here!
Do you need something, sir?
Where are my rice noodles?
Those military gentlemen was here first.
I'm cooking yours now. Doing it now.
Hold on.
This is even more delicious than the noodles in Guangzhou.
Well, I see this restaurant
feeds pigs first.
What did you say?
I didn't know pigs could understand human language.
I dare you to say that again!
I said you are pigs.
Who are pigs?
Zhao Fusheng pays his respects to his superior.
Who is the pig?
I am, sir.
A vice battalion commander
can be so hard on his comrades' troops.
If they were civilians
I bet you'd eat them alive, huh?
Sir, I wouldn't dare, sir.
I'm teaching you a lesson on behalf of Commander He.
If you were my soldier
I would parade you through the streets!
Lesson learned. Thank you, Commander.
Please take care on the road, Commander Ye!
Here are your rice noodles!
Chen Feng!
I have seen it all.
I apologize, I made a scene.
Well, I thought you guys were having a good time in Wuhan.
Why did you come to Nanchang?
I have no idea!
Now Commander He looks like he's possessed
and insisted on coming to Jiangxi with that Cantonese guy.
Now all the high posts in the army have been taken by the Cantonese
and we, the veterans who risked our lives,
are no longer popular.
That bearded He is just a western Hu'nan bandit
and is not like us.
Let me be frank with you.
He Long is singing Xipi with those scholars all day long.
Sing Xipi?
I don't know what it means either.
Even the Cooking Corps has asked about it.
CCP.
What is CCP then?
Chinese Communist Party.
Zhao Fusheng,
you must follow the right people in society these days.
How about this...
Will you follow me?
I can at least make you vice commander of a regiment.
Besides, we have
a special fund every month.
Our Jiangxi rice noodles are really good.
Try some.
I'll see you later, Chen Feng.
Everyone, there are 6,000 enemy troops garrisoned in Nanchang City.
They are set up mainly at the 5th Army Headquarters' rear office
in the Financial Commissioner's building.
The 23rd regiment of the KMT 3rd Army in the Examination Hall,
and the 24th regiment of KMT 3rd Army is at the New Camp Gate.
The enemy's main position occupies the area
from the main street to the Financial Commissioner's Building.
Commander He Long,
this is yours to take.
The artillery is ready to offer support at any time.
The gate tower,
with it's commanding height over Nanchang City,
is extremely important.
Ye Ting, your troops are charged with taking it.
Come on guys, all of you.
Come and take a picture!
We're about to start a fight
and it will be a tough one.
There are not many guards in the railway station
and it must be taken as soon as we begin,
in order to cut off their retreat.
Let me stress this last point:
He Long's men must take the Financial Commissioner's Building before dawn!
No problem!
Everyone wear a red scarve around your collar
and tie a white towel to your right arm.
A red cross should be placed
on everyone's flashlight lens
to avoid friendly fire
in combat at night.
You've thought of everything.
Regiment Commander, an invitation for you from Commander Zhu.
Chen Feng in Nanchang is a serious problem.
He was suspicious of us when we marched into the city.
If Chen wires to Lushan to see what's going on
all of us will be exposed.
As for me,
I agree with the uprising.
But...
the Comintern has given clear instructions to us
to win over Zhang Fakui.
So I hope you can comply with the wishes of the Central Committee.
So now we have everything ready
and suddenly there is an international influence stepping in
to obstruct the uprising.
I object!
I said, comply with the decision of the Central Committee.
Zhang Fakui will arrive in Nanchang on August 1st
and his goal is to come here and wear us down.
The uprising is like an arrow on the bow.
It cannot be stopped!
They keep shifting their commands.
This is Rightist Capitulation!
I think you are a Leftist radical!
To establish a new revolutionary team,
we must be willing to give everything up.
If we miss this chance, we'll regret it forever.
As the General Secretary of the Frontline Committee,
I can decide on all matters regarding the Nanchang uprising.
If you make such wild claims,
where does that leave
the Central Committee and the Comintern?
Tie him up!
Commander He!
This is a high-level internal meeting.
What are you doing here?
Facing a formidable enemy,
nobody has the right to demoralize the troops!
Nobody!
Enlai,
let me ask you this single question:
this uprising,
do we do it or not?
The uprising will not be delayed...
Zhou Enlai!
...unless I'm dismissed as General Secretary of the Frontline Committee on the spot.
You!
I don't think things are that complicated.
I have a solution.
Okay, let's hear it.
Take you out.
I'll take care of it.
What are you doing?
I didn't think
that communists would kill one of their own.
Sorry,
I'm not a communist yet.
Now the whole country is in white terror.
If something
happens to Comrade Zhang Guotao,
we won't receive any command.
Any problem for the uprising?
Well,
if... I mean if...
According to the Party Constitution,
everyone votes on it.
I have never been to Nanchang.
More than half. It meets the quorum.
The Nanchang Uprising is scheduled for 4a.m.
on August 1.
Marker: three gunshots.
Code word:
"Unifying the Country."
I'm back.
Zhao Fusheng, change your equipment.
Is there any action?
4a.m.
Dear friends,
cousins
and brothers!
Today we gather in Nanchang
and this place is honored
by your gracious presence!
Everyone, please enjoy your time
and get very, very drunk!
Hurrah!
Before we act,
I have a plan
to invite all the leaders
in Nanchang to drink
until they are
completely drunk.
This should buy you all some time.
This is the reason you asked for a fund?
Of course.
It costs money to rent a place,
buy alcohol
and find these people.
Nobody move!
Don't move!
I get first pick.
What are we waiting for? Let's take them.
Hey, Chen,
something on your mind?
Chief Zhu,
such a spectacle today...
I'm not used to it.
Basically every officer in Nanchang is here.
I'm concerned that if anything happens...
Excuse me.
Report!
Zhao Fusheng, one of our vice battalion commanders,
left and has not returned.
Zhao Fusheng!
That menace!
I've lectured him already.
Is it likely that he would leak the information?
Better play safe
than be sorry.
I suggest
we hold an emergency meeting now
and adjust the uprising plan.
Check your markers.
Once the fighting starts
we identify the markers only, not the person.
Chen Feng!
Fusheng.
Something terrible is happening!
Hurry up!
Everybody, assemble!
Everyone, assume your position
and prepare to fight!
Everyone,
assume your position
and prepare to fight!
Understand?
Yes, sir!
How are the preparations coming?
Two regiments of the 24th Division are ready
and every member is on standby.
The artillery outside the city is ready for battle.
The 20th Army is ready for battle.
I don't know what's happening with Zhu De's troops.
Don't worry.
He doesn't make mistakes.
Brothers!
Take the Financial Commissioner's Building
within the hour!
Yes, sir!
Move out!
Fire!
Fire!
Report!
Our 20th Army's Training Regiment
has seized the new barracks of the 3rd Army's 79th Regiment.
Don't move!
Don't move!
Nobody move!
Report!
The guard companies from the Training Regiment and 4th Regiment of the 24th Division
now occupy Niuhang Railway Station.
The Railway Station!
Nothing.
Why?
The phone line has been cut.
Report!
Our 72nd Regiment has captured
the 23rd Regiment of KMT's 3rd Army at the Examination Hall.
What's the situation?
Go on! It's nothing!
Go!
What are you doing?
Somebody help! Now! The machine-guns!
Retreat from the gate!
Report! The gate is being shelled!
He Long's troops have been discovered on the main street!
Attack!
Send the 6th Company to reinforce the city gate!
It must be held!
I want the Maxim machine-guns on the main street
where we make our final stand
against this He Long!
Save him!
Take a flour bag.
Provide cover fire!
Charge!
Follow!
Follow me to the gate!
Hurry up! Get everything!
Don't move! Nobody move!
Put down what's in your hands!
Put it down! Put everything down!
Don't move! Put your hands up!
Don't move! Drop it!
Don't move!
Take the hard cash first!
We're facing a revolution
and this money
is temporarily requisitioned.
It will be returned
when the war is over.
Understand?
We are writing you a receipt.
Quick!
Take it!
Go!
Go with several men, sneak out of the city
and ask for reinforcements!
Feng, one more thing.
Remember.
They wear red scarves on their collars
and white towels on their arms.
Don't move! Don't move!
Put the gun down!
Don't move! Identify yourself!
Don't move!
Don't shoot!
Password!
We're friends!
Remember, everyone has a red scarf on their collar
and a white towel tied to their right arm.
Why are you crying?
Go!
We met resistance at the gate. Requesting support!
How is the 20th Army doing on the main street?
It's a stalemate.
I'm going!
Let's move!
Commander! Commander!
He Long's troops are about to break through our defenses
and we can't hold much longer!
Outflank them!
Take cover!
Take cover!
Report!
He Long's troops have taken the clock tower
but face strong resistance at the Financial Commissioner's Building.
Fire!
Firing positions!
Retreat!
Report! We are unable take Deshengmen Gate
and our casualties are so heavy
that we are forced to retreat. Request reinforcements!
Stop crying!
Get me bandages now!
Give them to me now!
Stay with me!
Hold on!
Come help me, now!
Mortar!
Mortar!
Distance 370...
Fire!
Report!
Ye Ting commands reinforcement troops
to begin shelling Deshengmen Gate!
Get ready!
Don't stop! Drop everything you've got on them!
Fire!
Su Yu! Attack!
Get ready!
Go!
Retreat!
Grenade!
Get ready!
Fire!
Don't move!
Don't move!
Put the gun down!
Take them away!
Report!
The battle has ended!
Our troops have captured the Financial Commissioner's Building
and occupy Deshengmen Gate!
Don't move!
Stay down!
Don't move!
Take this!
Stay close to me!
Follow me!
Put down your gun!
Put the gun down!
Commander!
We have won!
Victory!
Brother, why are you so late?
The battle is over!
A Mosin-Nagant.
I saved this for you.
Don't be too cocky.
Later, I will return to you a new one.
Don't forget you said that.
Victory!
Soong Ching-ling, Tan Pingshan, Liu Yazi and Mao Zedong
have composed a Declaration of Members of the Central Committee.
What does it say?
One:
Oppose the directives and resolutions issued in the name
of the Central Party Bureau by a few members of the Central Committee in Wuhan.
Two:
Uphold the Three Principles of the People for building a society
of the people, by the people and for the people
and support the Three Great Policies of
allying with Russia and the Communist Party, and assisting the workers and peasants.
Three:
Work hard to build a new base area,
so as to convene the Third National Congress
outside the spheres of the old and new warlords, to discuss
the question of concentrating the revolutionary forces
and continuing the revolutionary work.
I really don't understand
why Mrs. Sun is involved with the communists.
Seven:
Actively prepare our forces
to wipe out new-style warlords like Chiang, Feng Yuxiang and Tang Shengzhi,
who represent the forces of all the imperialists,
the northern warlords, and feudal society within the country.
To wipe out Chiang, Feng Yuxiang and Tang Shengzhi.
I am the top of the list.
I guess this means
things between us are irreconcilable.
Commander-in-Chief,
Li Jishen wired us from Guangzhou to ask
what should be done about the rebellion in Nanchang.
Let them decide on their own.
Jishi,
south of the Yangtze receives little rain in late summer.
The newly planted plane trees in Nanjing
should be watered well.
Miss Mei-ling asked about this yesterday.
Yes, sir. I will keep that in mind.
Both Zhou Enlai and Mao Zedong are people with ideals.
They both have a desire
to transform China.
But this is in opposition to Chiang's interests.
I think Chiang
used us to have Li Dazhao killed.
The communists
will surely remember what we have done.
But in this world of ours
there is no cure for regret.
Attention!
Come,
Salute!
Come, come!
We've seized 5,000 rifles,
700,000 rounds
and captured 3,000 men.
This was a brilliant victory.
Zhang Fakui and Zhu Peide's troops
are marching to Nanchang.
Li Jishen sent Qian Dajun
and his troops from Guangzhou.
Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek's armies are forming an alliance
and a huge net has now been cast.
Nanchang,
we can't hold any longer.
Then we should quickly sweep the battlefield and lead our men south,
take the Chaozhou-Shantou region, and make use of their docks
to gain access to the goods and arms support from the Comintern.
We fight all the way to Guangzhou, gather our strength,
and prepare for the second Northern Expedition
to unite the whole China!
Enlai!
Nie Rongzhen, you are such a bad ass!
You have even delivered to me
Wang Jingwei's reserve force!
Your service is commendable!
From now on, the 25th Division is ours and will fight for us.
My only regret is
I failed to catch the uprising.
Nanchang is only the starting point.
Everything has just begun.
The Comintern considers
Mikhail Borodin and Chen Duxiu's errors to be serious.
They have brought disastrous consequences to China's revolutionary situation.
The suspension of Chen's position as general secretary
is both the decision of the Comintern
and the unanimous request from China's Party's comrades.
In the absence of Chen,
Comrades Qu Qiubai and Li Weihan will be in charge of the Central Committee's work.
A tall figure with long hair.
You must be Mao Zedong?
Big head and small figure...
I assume you are...
Deng Xixian. I just changed my name.
I am Deng Xiaoping now.
Clearly you are highly skilled to have escaped
from He'nan's white terror.
It was a narrow escape. I'll tell you all about it later
and I promise my story will astonish you.
Quick, get in there.
A big quarrel is going on inside.
China is not Turkey.
Since Chiang wants to be Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in China
we are left with no choice
but to firmly take him down.
To fight against Cheng Kai-shek
we must first solve the problems within the party.
The theme of today's meeting
is to criticize Chen Duxiu's right-wing capitulation errors,
correct the Party's working direction,
and deal with the current situation to turn the tide.
We see setbacks as a starting point.
We start over from the very beginning.
Enlai and others lead troops south to Guangzhou
to prepare to rebuild the revolutionary base,
to get rid of those two-faced careerists,
and to launch a new Northern Expedition.
This revolution
is not about the KMT alone.
It is also about communists,
workers, peasants and the masses.
Exactly. A revolution for the masses, for workers and peasants.
You are not a formal representative.
It is not your place to speak.
The Comintern decision is good
but the people they sent here are problematic.
What either Borodin or Manabendra Nath Roy does
is wishful thinking.
Chen Duxiu's mistake is overestimating the KMT.
Thus the Communist Party becomes not the host of the revolution
but merely a guest.
This causes us to lose all initiative.
If not for the military campaign by Enlai and others,
we would not even have the strength to fight back
when they turn their backs on us.
The April 12th Massacre
taught us a lesson:
political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.
Great! Well said!
Zedong,Zedong!
You are a party member with seniority
and your organizational skill can convince the masses.
We all hope you can go to Shanghai.
I'm just a country boy
and I'm not used to the city's tall buildings.
I plan to go back to Hu'nan.
Once the harvest comes,
I will get some guns on the border of Hu'nan and Jiangxi
and do something big.
Can you even go back?
The enemies in Changsha offer a handsome reward for your head
and the landlords would happily watch you be burned alive.
Since the very first day I joined the Party
I have been making every preparation.
Every day people are murdered there.
Even Heaven is shedding tears.
Let it cry. I will do my work.
He who has seen ghosts does not fear darkness,
because he knows well in his heart
that this is darkness before dawn.
I am the Party's General Secretary.
Listen to me and go to Shanghai.
Give it a second thought.
The Central Committee needs you.
Thank you all.
I'm not a communist!
Kaihui,
I think you should take our son and return to Shaoshan.
No.
Nowhere is safe.
More and more are killed every day.
Do you still remember
at Peking University,
when you carried me on your shoulders to watch the fireworks?
I do.
It is my dream that someday
I will watch them with you once again.
But once I leave,
we won't know
when we will meet again.
I'll be waiting for you.
If you don't return after half a year,
I will wait a year.
If not after a year,
I will wait ten years.
If not after ten years,
I will wait a lifetime.
Please just don't say anything.
Dad!
Don't look back.
Go!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Mr. Wang,
in the early morning,
the communists led rebel troops
and launched a fierce attack
on Qian Dajun's troops in Huichang.
The fighting was fierce.
Kill!
At 4p.m.
the rebel troops
occupied Huichang City.
The lower rank officers on both sides
are mostly Huangpu students.
They have the hearts to kill each other?
Charge!
In the end,
they engaged in hand-to-hand combat.
That's preposterous!
What about Qian Dajun?
He broke out,
but lost 5,000 troops.
These troops are under the direct control of Chiang's 1st Army.
Qian Dajun will not let that go.
When shephards quarrel,
the wolf has a winning game.
Ye Ting and Zhou Yiqun's
3rd Division of the 20th Army also suffered heavy causalities.
Cai Tingkai's 10th Division
defected on the battlefield
and left the Communist Party.
Cai Tingkai's defection
is a stunning blow to our troops' morale.
Rumors are spreading like wildfire.
Someone said
the ship was sinking.
Jump first and you survive.
Jump later and you die.
Cai Tingkai's such a bastard.
That bastard is gone
and I, Chen Yi, am here.
I started from Wuhan
and I kept running to catch up with you.
Finally,
I caught up with you in Huichang.
Mr. Zhou!
Commander He, what happened?
This is my application for admission to the Party.
Please grant me my wish!
I, He Long,
will follow the Communist Party
till my last breath!
Hurry!
Watch this red devil for me!
If he gets away, you'll be finished!
I'm going to the toilet.
Get going!
Were you rewarded
for my capture?
Rewarded?
The money is not even enough for the officials to distribute.
How could there be any left for someone as low as me?
Feel right here.
Down.
Take it out and have a look.
Three for each of you.
No more left.
The red devil escaped!
The red devil escaped!
Don't move!
This guy is really weird.
He doesn't say anything.
All he does is eat.
Please don't talk like that.
You captured me and took me here for no reason.
And I don't have a choice.
A big guy's gotta eat more.
Who are you?
Who are you?
National Revolutionary Army
2nd Army
Regiment Guard Commander
Lu Deming.
You can ask Mr. Luo.
Commander Lu,
this is the Central Commissioner,
Comrade Mao Zedong.
Comrade Mao Zedong!
I'm terribly sorry.
No need for that.
No need to apologize.
If you could give me some steamed radish
that would be enough.
Sure.
After we have taken Changsha,
there will be plenty of red stewed pork for you.
You want to attack Changsha?
Yes,
an echo of the Nanchang Uprising
and another heavy blow to those bastards.
To join the uprising movement,
Commander Lu used Zhang Fakui's transfer order
to lead 2,000 Regiment Guards to Nanchang.
But by the time we reached Fengxin County,
all the troops had withdrawn from Nanchang.
So I decided to
conserve our strength and rest here.
And as a result,
you were captured.
We must change our unit designations now.
Change our designations?
Yes and we must make entirely new flags.
No more blue sky, white sun, and red earth?
This Nationalist flag
can't be used anymore.
But we held up this flag
and fought under this flag during the Uprising.
The orphan next door is crying.
Warlords,
landlords, and capitalists
hate the workers' and peasants' armed movement.
They've been ordered by the Nationalists
to embark on a consolidation campaign.
From cities like Wuhan and Shanghai
to towns and villages,
you find everywhere their victims, wailing in despair.
Even Chongyang and Tongcheng Counties
have been completely decimated.
10% of those who joined the peasants' movement
have been executed.
With such atrocities,
how could the people still trust the government?
With such atrocities,
how could we continue to use
this flag and these symbols?
All right.
How should we rank the troops?
Let us use
1st Division, 1st Army of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Army!
Our troops have entered the boundary of Jieyang
and will reach the Chaozhou-Shantou region next.
But they face enemy troops from Guangdong and Guangxi in front.
Qian Dajun is right on their ass.
This dog skin plaster is so tightly attached
that you can't even shake it off.
To win in the Chaozhou-Shantou region,
we must first eliminate Qian Dajun.
I'll set an ambush for them.
We have a shortage of troops
which makes it impossible for us
to divide our forces.
I'm afraid peeling off this plaster with sheer force
might also take off a layer of skin.
I'll be in charge of holding Sanheba district.
They have 30,000 men.
How many soldiers can you give us?
3,000.00
And how many days will you need?
3
After 3 days
I will lead the combat force to meet you
and together we will fight our way to Guangzhou.
As long as I am alive,
Qian Dajun will not cross Sanheba District!
I have this one single question for you all.
Did participating in the Autumn Harvest Uprising
cause you a great deal of suffering?
Will any of you answer my question?
If nobody will answer my question,
I'll take it that none of you suffered.
Right?
If you don't speak up now,
there won't be another chance.
No crying about your suffering.
You hear me or not?
Commander Lu has made the stakes very clear.
In that case, right now we will set a few basic rules.
From now on, whether marching or fighting,
eating or sleeping out in the open air,
you shall not whine about your suffering.
Let me ask you again.
Will you suffer?
Yes!
Everyone, answer me together!
Will you suffer?
Yes!
Louder!
Yes!
We need to move soon.
Go! Move!
Take cover!
Hurry up!
Save the injured!
Save the injured!
Hurry up!
Retreat! Go!
Move!
Move!
Retreat! Go!
Comrade Lu sacrificed himself to give us cover.
He exchanged his life for our bloody lesson:
Large cities can't be attacked
and progressive ideology will not be tolerated.
Now we have only one path ahead of us.
We continue to march to Jinggangshan
to be kings of the mountain.
Use the grass dug up as camouflage.
Trenches should be dug in a V or a U shape.
Trenches should also be dug in the lowest area
to reduce injuries from shrapnel and to drain.
Remember, set up elbow platforms
so that while firing at the enemy
the maximum amount of energy can be saved.
Three rivers converge at Sanheba.
Qian Dajun is stationed on the west bank.
To fight us he must cross the Ting River
and he will land somewhere around here.
Now I will assign to each of you your missions.
Battalion Commander Li,
you set up a defense along the Shizi'an bank
and quietly wait for a chance to ambush.
Cai Qingchuan, Lin Biao and Chen Yi,
you ambush near Shizidong and Longhukeng.
We are short on ammunition, therefore,
no gunshots without my command.
Yes, sir!
Comrades, we are facing a tough battle.
Qian Dajun has 30,000 troops.
We've less than 3,000
and no reinforcements.
So I simply ask one thing from all of you:
no unnecessary sacrifice.
Jinggangshan has 5 wells.
This is the best place for the Worker-Peasant Rev. Army!
Over the past few months
so many communist heads have rolled.
But all of us here are survivors.
What is a survivor?
A survivor is someone
who lives the life of the dead
so that they did not die in vain,
but instead made a valuable sacrifice.
I hear Ye Ting's Independent Regiment built a Party branch
which plays the role of a fort for the Communists
that can't be worn down or destroyed.
This has made them a very capable force.
I think
even the regimental level is not enough.
This should be done on the company level.
Establish a Party representative system,
to have a Party group in a platoon,
Party members in a squad,
and the principle that the Party commands the gun will be implemented.
This point
I will report to the Central Committee in advance.
How can there be enough Party members?
Recruitment is happening now.
Those not afraid of death or not taken by greed,
and are capable of fighting for the poor,
they can be Party members.
Their line of defense stretches over 5 km on the opposite bank.
And we don't yet know where their vulnerabilities lie.
The artillery regiment is ready
and can bombard the opposite bank at anytime.
Have the enemy troops been located?
Send the 4th Regiment to cross the river
and carry out a search.
Report! Enemy has begun their attack!
Report! Enemy has reached the bank along Shizian
and the initial estimate is 2,000 men!
Wait.
Report! Enemy vanguard has landed at Shizian!
I order you to attack!
Lin Biao! Chen Yi!
Attack!
Our beach landing has met fierce resistance
and casualties are heavy!
Fire at the enemy defense line!
But the 4th Regiment is still engaged with the enemy!
Sometimes you gotta make a few sacrifices.
Fire!
Distance 175, to the right 003,
Get ready!
Fire!
Retreat!
Take cover!
Take cover now!
Take cover!
Get ready!
Fire!
Hurry!
Into the trench!
Hurry!
Now!
Into the trench!
Go!
Fire!
Everybody hide in the craters!
Why did we stop?
Keep firing! Now!
Report, Commander,
we've run out of shells.
What do you mean you're out?
We had a logistical problem,
more shells will arrive in 2 days.
Hurry! Save them!
Mom, I miss home!
I want to go home!
I don't want to die.
Mom, I'm so scared!
The battle raged the entire day
and we consumed a large amount of munitions.
All the soldiers in 3rd Company are dead.
Facing the enemy's attack tomorrow,
I don't know if we will be able to hold.
Here, collect the munitions!
And those too!
Go! Retreat!
Report! 1st Army has landed at Shizian and is in pursuit.
They will drive straight to Longhukeng!
You're in charge here.
Go!
Fire!
Report! 1st Regiment was ambushed at Longhukeng!
Report!
3rd Regiment has reached east bank
and is driving straight to main position!
2nd Regiment has begun their offensive!
Attack!
Grenade!
The machine-gun is silent! The machine-gun!
I'll go!
Grenade!
Gather all the weapons and munitions,
disarm the captives and take them away!
Yes, sir!
Hurry! Another assault is coming! Move!
Pick up the ammo!
Save the injured! Hurry!
Now we are down to less than two thousand men
and all the ambush positions have been exposed.
There is still one more day to hold.
What the hell should I do?
Nobody!
Commander Qian,
is it okay? How about this?
Comrades,
we have been fighting alone these past few days.
Many of our brothers have been sacrificed.
Facing our fallen brothers today
I, Zhu De, am filled with guilt.
However,
the precious time bought with our lives
grants the surviving opportunities for our main force.
Tell me,
is it worth it or not?
Yes!
The blocking mission is complete
and we are retreating from Sanheba.
On the opposite bank, Qian Dajun
is not going to let us out of here easily.
So I have decided
that 200 men will stay behind
to make our final stand against Qian Dajun
to help more people get out alive.
There is little hope for survival for those that stay.
Therefore,
if both father and son serve in the army,
the son leaves with the rest of the team.
If both older and younger brothers serve in the army,
the older brother stays.
Everyone, remember. The revolutionary road is long
and we are here to leave seeds for China's revolution.
I am the 11th Army, 25th Division, 73rd Regiment,
3rd Battalion Commander, Cai Qingchuan.
I request to stay.
11th Army, 24th Division, 72nd Regiment Commander,
Sun Shucheng,
is willing to stay and make a final stand.
Chen Yi, political director,
will stay and fight!
Report!
I am an orphan
and I am willing to stay!
I will stay!
I want to stay!
I should stay!
Brother!
I will stay!
Sit down!
We will all stay and fight!
Go back!
Listen to me,
you must preserve your lives!
The revolutionary needs you.
You are the hope for a new China!
Understand?
Be a warrior
but not a martyr!
Return alive!
Yes, sir!
Salute!
Send my order. Capture Sanheba within one hour!
Comrades, we have only one mission.
Hold Sanheba to buy time for the main force to retreat.
Heaven is waiting for you!
Get ready!
Yes, sir!
Kill!
Be a warrior
but not a martyr!
Be a warrior
but not a martyr!
Be a warrior
but not a martyr!
Liu Song!
Hurry!
The detonator!
Right turn!
Salute!
Give everyone from Huangpu
an elaborate funeral.
You the 73rd Regiment?
You the 73rd Regiment?
Su Yu,
you are late.
Sanheba...
You didn't see...
How is it on your side?
Our main force was ambushed
in the Chaozhou-Shantou region.
So many men
were killed this way?
What happened?
Where is the main force now?
There were just too many of them.
We fired every single bullet we had.
Commander Ye Ting and He Long
both broke through and are now missing.
Comrade Zhou Enlai became very ill
and was sent to Hong Kong.
We have failed.
Someday,
we will avenge all the martyrs we have lost.
I promise you that I will seize Nanjing
and destroy our enemies.
Su Yu, return to your unit!
Yes, sir!
73rd Regiment, assemble!
Attention!
Comrades,
Chiang Kai-shek has betrayed the revolution
and has slaughtered the revolutionaries.
Now we have no choice but to launch this revolt.
The Nanchang Insurrection
is proof to the entire world
that we are still alive.
Constant fighting has caused
our once great army of 20,000 strong,
to be reduced to 800.
These souls baptized by fire,
will merge with people's destiny.
From now on, people will believe us,
support us
and fight together for the establishment of a new China.
In the past, I was a Nationalist lieutenant general
From today
I am just like you,
a new soldier of the revolutionary army.
Everything we do today
is with the highest honor!
Yes!
Zhu De disappeared.
Mao Zedong vanished.
Zhou Enlai, He Long,
Ye Ting... nearly all of them are nowhere to be found.
Music.
Even if they are still alive,
they are like wandering ghosts
and their days are numbered.
The Party members' reinvestigation,
how is it going?
The report says it's going very smoothly.
Before the purging, we had more than 1 million members
and after re-registration we have 700,000.
When did those Communist dogs gain 300,000 new members?
Not that many.
Quite a few old members did not register again.
So in other words, they were automatically withdrawn from the Nationalist Party.
Commander in Chief,
Madam, water.
According to the report,
nearly half all members have quit the party
and new members
from various places have filled in.
What kind of people are they?
Local tyrants, evil gentry, bandits and despots.
Mao Zedong, a peasant.
Zhu De, an army riffraff.
Zhou Enlai, an intellectual.
What do they have to rival me?
In 10 years,
let's see which side still has its flag waving high!
Mr. Zhou,
Madam Deng has commanded
that you must take time to rest.
Zhu De finally broke through several blockades
and is leading his troops
to the boundary of Hu'nan and Jiangxi
to meet Mao Zedong's troops.
Mao Zedong has troops as well?
Over the past few years
Mao Zedong has traveled through Hu'nan's villages
studying China's conditions.
After leaving Wuhan,
he went to the border of Hu'nan and Jiangxi
and established an armed force of workers and peasants.
Now they are together
and a hope is born for China's future.
China's revolution
still depends on you.
It depends on many people.
Zhu De, He Long, Ye Ting,
and thousands of generals and soldiers.
Well, this body of mine has failed me.
At this critical moment
I must recuperate in Hong Kong.
During the Huangma Uprising, Pan Zhongru, Cao Xuekai and others
fought and won a little piece of heaven on earth.
I hear He Long is doing quite well in western Hu'nan.
It's impressive.
In the New Year's eve uprising in South Hu'nan,
Commander Zhu gathered a force of more than 10,000 men.
Xu Xiangqian led the workers' red guards
and joined an uprising in Guangzhou.
Peng Dehuai is also planning an uprising in Pingjiang County, Hu'nan.
I heard that
Zhu De is leading his troops to come to Jinggangshan.
That's right.
I can hardly wait.
Commissioner Mao,
the comrades who joined the uprising in South Hu'nan are here.
Zhu De is here as well.
Come, let us welcome them!
Comrade Zhu De,
after the failure in the Chaozhou-Shantou Region,
your army had a bloody battle in Sanheba alone.
And after marching for thousands of miles,
800 defeated men became a force of more than 10,000 strong.
The pillar of strength in our revolution
has been no one but you!
I have long heard of you and your work, Zedong.
To establish a base in barren mountains that range for miles and miles,
is something only a hero could achieve.
I have eight words hidden in my heart:
"So many extreme difficulties and a narrow escape."
I also have 8 words for you,
for Dr. Sun Yat-sen,
for Chiang Kai-shek and for all of our enemies:
"A single spark
can start a wild fire."
Salute!
The new China
depends on you!
"In September 1927, Mao Zedong led the famous Sanwan Reorganization,
"which founded the system under the leadership of the CCP.
"In December 1929, the Fourth Red Army held the 9th meeting of the CCP,
"which saw the adoption of the Gutian Congress Resolution,
"established the principle to build the Party ideologically and the Army politically
"and pointed the way to construct a new proletarian People's Army.
"The Red Army had thus entered into a new era and began to develop and grow."
The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army
is an armed body that can carry out the political tasks of the revolution.
This is the valuable experience
we gathered from our bitter struggles.
Well said!
I, Zhu De, hereby bear witness.
I as well!
I also!
The Red Army
is the people's army.
Besides fighting to destroy the enemy's military strength,
it should shoulder such important tasks
as providing propaganda to the people,
organizing the masses,
and arming them. These are it's primary duties.
The central task and the highest form of revolution
is the seizure of power by an armed force.
We will arm our troops
with proletarian ideology
as a force to correct all errant ideas.
Our principle is that
the Party commands the gun.

00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,940
The world is changed.

Han mathon ne nen.

4
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,240
I feel it in the water.

Han mathon ne chae.

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,340
I feel it in the earth.

A han noston ned 'wilith.

8
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,340
I smell it in the air.

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,640
Much that once was...

10
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,440
...is lost.

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,140
For none now live who remember it.

12
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:04,640
The Lord of the Rings.

13
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,340
It began with the forging of the great rings.

14
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,540
Three were given to the elves:

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,440
Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.

16
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,240
Seven to the dwarf-lords:

17
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,740
Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

18
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,540
And nine...

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,640
...nine rings were gifted to the race of men...

20
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,740
...who, above all else, desire power.

21
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,940
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.

22
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,740
But they were all of them deceived.

23
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,140
For another ring was made.

24
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,440
In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...

25
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,340
... the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a master ring...

26
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,640
... to control all others.

27
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,740
And into this ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

28
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,140
...and his will to dominate all life.

29
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,040
One ring to rule them all.

30
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,640
One by one...

31
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,340
... the free lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the ring.

32
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,640
But there were some who resisted.

33
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,740
A last alliance of men and elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.

34
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,640
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.

35
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,740
Tangado haid! (Hold positions!)

36
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,440
Leithio i philinn! (Fire the arrows!)

37
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,640
Victory was near.

38
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,740
But the power of the ring...

39
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,840
...could not be undone.

40
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,940
It was in this moment...

41
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,540
... when all hope had faded...

42
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,740
... that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

43
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,240
Sauron, the enemy of the free peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.

44
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,540
The ring passed to Isildur...

45
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,840
... who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.

46
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,740
But the hearts of men...

47
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,440
...are easily corrupted.

48
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,240
And the ring of power has a will of its own.

49
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,140
It betrayed Isildur...

50
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,440
... to his death.

51
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,440
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

52
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,940
...were lost.

53
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,040
History became legend...

54
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,240
...legend became myth.

55
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,240
And for two and a half thousand years...

56
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,240
... the ring passed out of all knowledge.

57
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,640
Until, when chance came...

58
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,440
...it ensnared a new bearer.

59
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,540
My precious.

60
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,440
The ring came to the creature Gollum...

61
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,440
... who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.

62
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,740
And there it consumed him.

63
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,940
It came to me.

64
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,540
My own. My love. My own.

65
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,440
My precious.

66
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,540
The ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life.

67
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,540
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

68
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,240
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited.

69
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,840
Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.

70
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,940
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

71
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,940
... whispers of a nameless fear.

72
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,440
And the ring of power perceived...

73
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,440
...its time had now come.

74
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,540
It abandoned Gollum.

75
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,540
But something happened then
the ring did not intend.

76
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,040
It was picked up by the most
unlikely creature imaginable.

77
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
What's this?

78
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,140
A hobbit.

79
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,940
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

80
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,040
A ring.

81
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,040
Lost!

82
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,440
The 22nd day of September...

83
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,140
My precious is lost!

84
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,740
For the time will soon come...

85
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,040
... when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.

86
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,340
...in the year 1400...

87
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,940
...by Shire-reckoning.

88
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:54,740
Bag End, Bagshot Row.
Hobbiton, Westfarthing...

89
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,040
...the Shire...

90
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,040
...Middle-earth.

91
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,940
The third age of this world.

92
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:15,340
The Fellowship of the Ring.

93
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,240
There and back again.

94
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,940
A Hobbit's tale.

95
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,040
By Bilbo Baggins.

96
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,540
Now...

97
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,340
...where to begin?

98
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,740
Ah, yes....

99
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,040
"Concerning...

100
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,740
...Hobbits."

101
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,340
Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire...

102
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,640
...for many hundreds of years...

103
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,940
...quite content to ignore and be ignored...

104
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,040
...by the world of the big folk.

105
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:09,940
Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...

106
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,440
...Hobbits must seem of little importance...

107
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,540
...being neither renowned as great warriors...

108
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,940
...nor counted among the very wise.

109
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,340
Frodo! Someone at the door.

110
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,140
In fact, it has been remarked by some...

111
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,640
... that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.

112
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,340
A rather unfair observation...

113
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,040
...as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...

114
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,340
...and the smoking of pipe-weed.

115
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,640
But where our hearts truly lie...

116
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,940
...is in peace and quiet...

117
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
...and good, tilled earth.

118
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:01,140
For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow.

119
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,640
And yes, no doubt to others our ways seem quaint.

120
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,040
But today of all days.
It is brought home to me...

121
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:20,540
It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

122
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,040
Frodo, the door!

123
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,840
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

124
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,740
Frodo!

125
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,940
Down from the door where it began

126
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,540
And I must follow if I can

127
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,740
The road goes ever on and on

128
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,240
Down from the door where it began

129
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,440
Now far ahead the road has gone

130
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,940
And I must follow if I can
- You're late.

131
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,040
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

132
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,440
Nor is he early.
He arrives precisely when he means to.

133
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,840
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

134
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,440
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

135
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,340
How is the old rascal?

136
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,440
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

137
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,040
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole piece in an uproar.

138
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,240
Well, that should please him.

139
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,240
Half the Shire's been invited.

140
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,140
And the rest of them are turning up anyway.

141
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:10,540
And so life in the Shire goes on...

142
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,840
... very much as it has this past age.

143
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:19,440
Full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.

144
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,640
If it comes at all.

145
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,340
For things are made to endure in the Shire...

146
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,940
...passing from one generation to the next.

147
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,340
There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill...

148
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,040
...in Bag End.

149
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,540
And there always will be.

150
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,540
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lateIy.

151
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,140
I mean, more than usual.

152
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,040
He's taken to locking himself in his study.

153
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,740
He spends hours and hours poring over
old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.

154
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,240
Where's it gone?

155
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,040
He's up to something.

156
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,640
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

157
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,540
But I know you have something to do with it.

158
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,940
Good gracious me.

159
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,040
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

160
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,240
Indeed.

161
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,740
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

162
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,040
If you're referring to the incident with the dragon.
I was barely involved.

163
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,940
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

164
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,240
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

165
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,640
Oh, really?

166
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,240
Gandalf! Gandalf!

167
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,640
Fireworks, Gandalf!

168
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,240
- Gandalf!
- Fireworks, Gandalf!

169
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,240
Gandalf?

170
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,740
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

171
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,140
So am I.

172
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,440
No, thank you!

173
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,340
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

174
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,140
And what about very old friends?

175
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,140
Gandalf?

176
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,140
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

177
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,440
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

178
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,340
You haven't aged a day.

179
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,940
Come on, come in!

180
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,540
Welcome, welcome.

181
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,240
Oh, here we are.

182
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,440
Tea...or maybe something a littIe stronger?

183
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,340
I've got a few bottles of the old winyard left - 1296.

184
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,440
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

185
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,140
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

186
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,040
Just tea, thank you.

187
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,140
I was expecting you sometime last week.

188
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,640
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

189
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,940
You caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid.
We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle....

190
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,540
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

191
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,740
We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart....

192
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,440
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

193
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,440
I've just found some sponge cake.

194
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,740
I could make you some eggs if you'd li...

195
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,240
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

196
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,540
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

197
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,640
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

198
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,440
I'm not at home!

199
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,040
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

200
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,340
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

201
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,440
They've never forgiven me for living this long.

202
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,440
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

203
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,540
...never giving me a moment's peace.

204
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,840
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

205
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,540
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

206
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,640
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

207
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,140
All the arrangements are made.

208
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,740
Oh, thank you.

209
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,540
Frodo suspects something.

210
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,240
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

211
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,040
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

212
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,440
You will tell him, won't you?

213
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,340
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

214
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,140
I know.

215
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,840
He'd probably come with me if I asked him.

216
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,740
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

217
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,740
The woods, the fields.

218
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,240
Little rivers.

219
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,440
I am old, Gandalf.

220
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,940
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

221
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,840
I feel thin.

222
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,740
Sort of stretched...

223
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,240
...like butter scraped over too much bread.

224
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,940
I need a holiday. A very Long holiday.

225
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,340
And I don't expect I shall return.

226
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,840
In fact, I mean not to.

227
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,440
Old Toby.
The finest weed in the Southfarthing.

228
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,540
Gandalf, my old friend...

229
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,440
...this will be a night to remember.

230
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,440
Hello, hello.

231
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,640
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

232
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,240
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

233
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,340
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

234
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,340
Go on!

235
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,240
So there I was...

236
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,540
...at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.

237
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,740
And they were all arguing amongst themselves...

238
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,240
...about how they were going to cook us.

239
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:05,440
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

240
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,040
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

241
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,840
...that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

242
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,340
...and turned them all to stone!

243
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,140
Quickly.

244
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,340
Up they go!

245
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,540
No no, the big one - big one

246
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,440
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

247
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,540
Are all these children yours?

248
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,640
Good gracious, you have been productive.

249
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,040
Bilbo?

250
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,440
Sackville-Bagginses!

251
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,740
Quickly, hide!

252
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,840
Thank you, my boy.

253
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,640
You're a good lad, Frodo.

254
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,740
I'm very selfish, you know.

255
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,640
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

256
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,240
I don't know why I took you in after
your mother and father died...

257
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,940
...but it wasn't out of charity.

258
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,940
I think it was because...

259
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,340
...of all my numerous relations...

260
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,140
...you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.

261
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,340
Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's home brew?

262
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,240
No.

263
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,040
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

264
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,540
The point is, Frodo...

265
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,640
...you'll be all right.

266
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,040
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

267
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,840
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

268
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,540
This was your idea.

269
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,940
Bilbo.

270
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,740
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

271
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,340
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for thousands of years.

272
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,340
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

273
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,140
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

274
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,340
I might've known.

275
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,340
Speech, Bilbo!

276
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,640
Speech!

277
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,840
Speech!

278
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,340
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

279
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,240
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

280
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,940
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

281
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,240
...Hornblowers...

282
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,040
...Bolgers...

283
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,040
...Bracegirdles...

284
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,840
...and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

285
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,140
Today is my 111th birthday!

286
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,540
Happy birthday!

287
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,840
But alas, eleventh-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

288
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,040
...such excellent and admirable Hobbits.

289
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,740
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

290
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,440
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

291
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,840
I have things to do.

292
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,340
I've put this off for far too long.

293
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,140
I regret to announce this is the end!

294
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,540
I'm going now.

295
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,540
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

296
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,140
Goodbye.

297
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,440
I suppose you think that was terribly clever.

298
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,040
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

299
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,140
There are many magic rings in
this world, Bilbo Baggins...

300
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,440
...and none of them should be used lightly.

301
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,640
It was just a bit of fun.

302
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,540
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

303
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,440
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

304
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,340
As often as I can spare them.

305
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,740
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

306
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,240
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

307
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,740
It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.

308
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,840
No. Wait, it's...

309
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,040
...here in my pocket.

310
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,840
Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now?

311
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,040
Yet, after all, why not?

312
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,340
- Why shouldn t I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

313
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,040
Is that so hard?

314
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,640
Well, no.

315
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,540
And yes.

316
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,540
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel l ike parting with it.

317
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,640
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

318
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,940
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

319
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,140
It's mine.

320
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,040
My own.

321
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,240
- My precious.
- Precious?

322
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,340
It's been called that before, but not by you.

323
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,140
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

324
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,140
I think you've had that ring quite long enough.

325
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,140
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

326
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,540
Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks.

327
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,440
I am not trying to rob you.

328
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,240
I'm trying to help you.

329
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,940
All your long years, we've been friends.

330
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,540
Trust me as you once did.

331
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,240
Let it go.

332
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,740
You're right, Gandalf.

333
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,540
The ring must go to Frodo.

334
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,940
It's late. The road is long.

335
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,640
Yes, it is time.

336
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,240
Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.

337
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,140
I've thought up an ending for my book:

338
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,640
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

339
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,440
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

340
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,940
Goodbye, Gandalf.

341
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,240
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

342
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:52,240
The road goes ever on and on...

343
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,340
Until our next meeting.

344
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,240
It's mine. My own.

345
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,940
My precious.

346
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,040
Riddles in the dark.

347
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,840
Bilbo!

348
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,440
Bilbo!

349
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,140
My precious.

350
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,840
Precious.

351
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,540
He's gone, hasn't he?

352
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,440
He talked for so long about leaving...

353
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,340
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

354
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,840
Gandalf?

355
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,740
Bilbo's ring.

356
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,440
He's gone to stay with the elves.

357
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,640
He's left you Bag End.

358
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,940
Along with all his possessions.

359
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,940
The ring is yours now.

360
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,040
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

361
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,440
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

362
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,840
- Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

363
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,440
I don't understand.

364
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,840
Neither do I.

365
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,440
Keep it secret.

366
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,440
Keep it safe.

367
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,540
Shire!

368
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,940
Baggins!

369
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,340
"The year 3434 of the second age.

370
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,840
Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...

371
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,840
...and the finding of the ring of power."

372
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,240
"It has come to me.

373
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,840
The one ring.
It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom.

374
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,440
All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...

375
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,440
...for I will risk no hurt to the ring.

376
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,240
It is precious to me...

377
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,740
...though I buy it with great pain.

378
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,940
The markings upon the band begin to fade.

379
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,940
The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.

380
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,240
A secret now that only fire can tell."

381
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,940
Shire...

382
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,040
...Baggins.

383
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:46,540
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

384
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,740
That way.

385
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,640
"Hey ho to the dock I go

386
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,040
To heal my heart and drown my woe

387
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,540
Rain may fall and wind may blow

388
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,640
But there still be...

389
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,240
...many miles to go

390
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,440
Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain

391
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,740
And the stream that falls from hill to plain

392
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,840
Better than rain or rippling brook

393
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,440
Is a mug of beer inside this Took!"

394
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,640
There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire.

395
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,840
Dwarves and others of a less than savory nature.

396
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,940
War is brewing.

397
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,340
The mountains are fair teeming with goblins.

398
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,340
Far-off tales and children s stories, that's all that is.

399
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,940
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

400
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,940
Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking.

401
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,740
And proud of it.

402
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,340
- Cheers, Gaffer.
- Aye. Cheers.

403
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:48,340
Weel it's none of our concern what
goes on beyond our borders.

404
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,740
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

405
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,440
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

406
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,040
Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale.

407
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,640
Mind who you're sweet-taking.

408
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:10,240
Don't worry, Sam.
Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one.

409
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,540
Does she?

410
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,140
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mr. Frodo.

411
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,440
Is it secret? Is it safe?

412
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,440
What are you doing?

413
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,640
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

414
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,040
It's quite cool.

415
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,240
What can you see?

416
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,440
Can you see anything?

417
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,640
Nothing.

418
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,140
There's nothing.

419
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,840
Wait.

420
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,140
There are markings.

421
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:41,040
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

422
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,740
There are few who can.

423
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:49,040
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

424
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,940
Mordor!

425
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,140
In the common tongue, it says:

426
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,840
"One ring to rule them all...

427
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,440
...One ring to find them...

428
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,840
...One ring to bring them all...

429
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,140
...and in the darkness bind them."

430
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,840
This is the One ring...

431
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:14,140
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

432
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,440
Taken by IsiIdur from the hand of Sauron himself.

433
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,840
Bilbo found it.

434
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,240
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.

435
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:28,940
For 60 years, the ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping...

436
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,540
...prolonging his life, delaying old age.

437
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:37,540
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

438
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,240
The ring has awoken.

439
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,140
It's heard its master's call.

440
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,140
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

441
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,040
No, Frodo.

442
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:59,340
The spirit of Sauron endured.

443
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:04,740
His life force is bound to the ring,
and the ring survived.

444
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,340
Sauron has returned.

445
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,340
His orcs have multiplied.

446
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:14,540
His fortress at Barad-d�r
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

447
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,440
Sauron needs only this ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

448
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,840
He is seeking it.

449
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,740
Seeking it - All his thought is bent on it.

450
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,840
For the ring yearns above all else...

451
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,440
...to return to the hand of its master.

452
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,540
They are one...

453
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,640
...the ring and the Dark Lord.

454
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,040
Frodo...

455
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,340
...he must never find it.

456
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,640
All right.

457
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,240
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

458
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,140
No one knows it's here, do they?

459
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,040
Do they, Gandalf?

460
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,440
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the ring.

461
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,640
I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum.

462
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,040
But the enemy found him first.

463
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,340
I don't know how long they tortured him.

464
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,940
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:

465
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,340
Shire!

466
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,140
Baggins!

467
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,240
Shire.

468
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,140
Baggins.
But that would lead them here!

469
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,140
Who goes there?

470
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,140
Take it, Gandalf!

471
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,640
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

472
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,040
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

473
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:40,540
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

474
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,340
I dare not take it.

475
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,140
Not even to keep it safe.

476
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,340
Understand, Frodo...

477
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,540
...I would use this ring from a desire to do good.

478
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:05,540
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

479
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,240
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.

480
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,740
No, it can't.

481
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,540
What must I do?

482
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,540
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

483
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,140
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

484
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,540
Bree.

485
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,440
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

486
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,140
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

487
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,040
- And the ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

488
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,240
I don't have any answers.

489
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:48,140
I must see the head of my order.
He is both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

490
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,640
He'll know what to do.

491
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:54,040
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

492
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,840
That name is not safe outside the Shire.

493
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:00,740
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

494
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,640
I can cut across country easily enough.

495
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,540
My dear Frodo.

496
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,840
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

497
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,840
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

498
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,440
And yet, after a hundred years...

499
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,640
...they can still surprise you.

500
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,740
Get down.

501
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,240
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

502
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,040
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.

503
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,940
I was just cutting the grass under
the window there...If you follow me.

504
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,640
A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?

505
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,740
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

506
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,040
Nothing important.

507
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,040
That is, I heard a good deal
about a ring, and a Dark Lord...

508
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,740
...and something about the end of the world but...

509
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:59,440
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

510
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,940
No?

511
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,340
Perhaps not.

512
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,940
I've thought of a better use for you.

513
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,640
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

514
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,440
Be careful, both of you.

515
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,440
The enemy has many spies in his service:

516
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,540
Birds, beasts.

517
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,240
Is it safe?

518
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,240
Never put it on...

519
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,840
...for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

520
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,540
Always remember, Frodo...

521
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,140
...the ring is trying to get back to its master.

522
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,740
It wants to be found.

523
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,440
This is it.

524
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,940
This is what?

525
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,340
If I take one more step...

526
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:33,640
...it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

527
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,540
Come on, Sam.

528
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,840
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

529
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,040
- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
- "Going out your door.

530
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:58,640
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

531
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:02,940
... there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."

532
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,740
Sam.

533
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,440
Wood-elves.

534
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,540
They're going to the harbor
beyond the White Towers.

535
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,840
To the Grey Havens.

536
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,540
They're leaving Middle-earth.

537
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,840
Never to return.

538
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,840
I don't know why...

539
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,040
...it makes me sad.

540
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:02,540
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

541
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,240
Just shut your eyes...

542
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,040
...and imagine you're back in your own bed...

543
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,240
...with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow.

544
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,240
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

545
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,240
I'm never going to be able to sleep out here.

546
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,940
Me neither, Sam.

547
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:03,540
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.

548
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,440
The hour grows late.

549
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,040
And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard...

550
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,840
...seeking my counsel.

551
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:15,940
For that is why you have come, is it not?

552
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,440
My old friend.

553
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,340
Saruman.

554
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,140
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.

555
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,240
So the ring of power has been found.

556
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:33,540
All these long years, it was in the Shire.

557
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:37,040
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

558
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:41,940
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

559
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:46,840
But we still have time.
Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

560
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,640
Time?

561
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,240
What time do you think we have?

562
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:56,440
Sauron has regained much of his former strength.

563
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,940
He cannot yet take physical form...

564
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,840
...but his spirit has lost none of its potency.

565
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:07,440
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

566
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,940
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh.

567
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:18,740
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

568
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:24,740
A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.

569
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:27,640
The eye of Sauron.

570
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:30,440
He is gathering all evil to him.

571
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:32,640
Very soon, he'll have summoned an army...

572
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,740
...great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.

573
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,440
You know this?

574
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,540
How?

575
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,740
I have seen it.

576
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,340
A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

577
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,640
Why?

578
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,740
Why should we fear to use it?

579
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:58,340
They are not all accounted for,
the lost seeing-stones.

580
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,740
We do not know who else may be watching.

581
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,140
The hour is later than you think.

582
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,640
Sauron's forces are already moving.

583
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,640
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

584
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,040
The Nine?

585
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,140
They crossed the river Isen on Midsummer's Eve...

586
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,140
...disguised as riders in black.

587
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,240
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the ring.

588
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:30,140
And kill the one who carries it.

589
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,040
Frodo!

590
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:49,040
You did not seriously think that a hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

591
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:52,640
There are none who can.

592
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,840
Against the power of Mordor...

593
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,740
...there can be no victory.

594
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,840
We must join with him, Gandalf.

595
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,440
We must join with Sauron.

596
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,740
It would be wise, my friend.

597
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,840
Tell me...

598
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,540
...friend...

599
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:23,440
...when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?

600
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,740
I gave you the chance of...

601
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:08,540
...aiding me willingly...

602
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,840
...but you have elected the way of pain!

603
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,740
Mr. Frodo?

604
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,140
Frodo? Frodo!

605
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,740
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you taking about?

606
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:47,840
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

607
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,540
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

608
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,540
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

609
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,540
Frodo.

610
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,040
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

611
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,640
Get off him.

612
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,640
Come on, Frodo.

613
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,640
What's the meaning of this?

614
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:12,140
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

615
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,540
You get back here!

616
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:17,840
Get out of my field!

617
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,740
You'll know the devil if I catch up with you!

618
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,940
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

619
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,340
And some cabbages.

620
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:28,440
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

621
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,540
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin. My point is...

622
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:35,040
...he's clearly overreacting.

623
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,740
Run!

624
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,740
Oh, that was close.

625
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:56,940
I think I've broken something.

626
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,340
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

627
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:04,040
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

628
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,640
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

629
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,840
That's mine.

630
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,240
That's nice, Merry.

631
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,840
Here's a nice one, Sam.

632
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,440
I think we should get off the road.

633
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,140
Get off the road!

634
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:38,740
Quick!

635
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,940
Be quiet!

636
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,440
What was that?

637
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,640
Anything?

638
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,840
Nothing.

639
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,840
What is going on?

640
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,040
That Black Rider was looking for something.
Or someone.

641
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:47,940
Frodo?

642
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:49,740
Get down!

643
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,840
I have to leave the Shire.

644
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,240
Sam and I must get to Bree.

645
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,840
Right.

646
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,440
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

647
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,040
Run!

648
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:30,240
This way! Follow me!

649
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:34,940
Run!

650
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,940
Get the rope, Sam!

651
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,140
Frodo!

652
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,240
Run, Frodo!

653
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:57,740
Go!
- Hurry!

654
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:00,440
Frodo, come on!

655
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,540
- Come on! Faster!
- Jump!

656
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:22,540
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

657
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:38,840
Come on.

658
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,340
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

659
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,740
Hobbits. Four hobbits!

660
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:03,740
What's more, out of the Shire by your talk.
What business brings you to Bree?

661
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:07,440
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

662
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,040
All right young sir, I meant no offense.

663
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:13,740
It's my job to ask questions after nightfall.

664
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:16,940
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

665
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:19,240
Can't be too careful.

666
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,340
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

667
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,040
Excuse me.

668
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,840
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

669
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:17,940
If you're looking for accommodation, we got
some nice cozy hobbit-sized rooms available.

670
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:22,940
Always proud to cater to little folk, Mister...?

671
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:26,140
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

672
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:29,940
- Underhill, yeah.
- We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

673
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:33,240
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

674
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:35,440
Gandalf.

675
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,940
Oh, yes...

676
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,240
...I remember. Elderly chap.

677
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,540
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

678
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:45,740
Not seen him for six months.

679
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:53,940
What do we do now?

680
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:02,340
Sam...

681
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,340
...he'll be here. He'll come.

682
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,240
Get out of my way!

683
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:13,340
What's that?

684
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:15,940
This, my friend, is a pint.

685
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,840
It comes in pints?

686
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,740
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

687
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,940
That fellow's done nothing but
stare at you since we arrived.

688
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,140
Excuse me.

689
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,840
That man in the corner. Who is he?

690
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:47,440
He's one of them Rangers. They're dangerous
folk they are, wandering the wilds.

691
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:52,140
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but 'round here he's known as Strider.

692
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:55,840
Strider.

693
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:12,040
Baggins...

694
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,140
Baggins...

695
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:24,840
Baggins...

696
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,540
Baggins...

697
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,140
Baggins...
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

698
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,440
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

699
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,740
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

700
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:41,040
...and my third cousin, twice removed....

701
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,340
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

702
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:19,340
You cannot hide.

703
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:25,340
I see you.

704
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,840
There is no life...

705
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,140
...in the void.

706
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,840
Only...

707
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,340
...death.

708
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:47,040
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

709
01:02:51,940 --> 01:02:52,840
What do you want?

710
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:55,140
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

711
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:58,540
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

712
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:01,340
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

713
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:05,140
...but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.

714
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,340
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

715
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:10,640
Yes.

716
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:14,640
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

717
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:21,140
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

718
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:26,940
You have a stout heart, little hobbit.
But that will not save you.

719
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:30,140
You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo.

720
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:31,440
They're coming.

721
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:56,540
What are they?

722
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:00,840
They were once men.

723
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:03,240
Great kings of men.

724
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,840
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

725
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:10,640
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

726
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:14,140
One by one, falling into darkness.

727
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,840
Now they are slaves to his will.

728
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:20,940
They are the Nazg�l.

729
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:23,740
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

730
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:26,140
At all times they feel...

731
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:28,140
... the presence of the ring...

732
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:32,740
...drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.

733
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:45,740
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the wild.

734
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:57,940
How can we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

735
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:01,140
I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer...

736
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:05,340
...and feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

737
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:08,840
We have no choice but to trust him.

738
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:12,340
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

739
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:18,040
- To the house of Elrond.
- Did you hear that? Rivendell.

740
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:21,440
We're going to see the elves.

741
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:47,240
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

742
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:50,240
- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

743
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,640
What about second breakfast?

744
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:59,040
Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.

745
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:04,540
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

746
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:08,940
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

747
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:16,140
Pippin!

748
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:35,940
What do they eat when they can't get Hobbit?

749
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:54,740
"Tin�viel elvanui
("Tin�viel the elven-fair)

750
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:02,940
Elleth alfirin ethelhael
(Immortal maiden elven-wise)

751
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:10,240
O hon ring finnil fuinui
(About him cast her night-dark hair)

752
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:14,740
A renc gelebrin thiliol."
(And arms like silver glimmering.")

753
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,140
Who is she?

754
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:20,340
This woman you sing of.

755
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:26,240
'Tis the lady of Luthien.

756
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:31,440
The elf-maiden who gave her
love to Beren, a mortal.

757
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,540
What happened to her?

758
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:40,240
She died.

759
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:46,540
Get some sleep, Frodo.

760
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:00,940
The power of Isengard is at your command...

761
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:05,440
... Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

762
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:14,640
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.

763
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:24,640
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

764
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:27,140
We have work to do.

765
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:14,440
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

766
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:16,840
Rip them all down.

767
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:47,040
This was the great watchtower of Amon S�l.

768
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:51,340
We shall rest here tonight.

769
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:06,440
These are for you.
Keep them close.

770
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:09,240
I'm going to have a look around.

771
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:13,540
Stay here.

772
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:18,340
My tomato's burst.

773
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,440
Could I have some bacon?

774
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:22,540
Want a tomato, Sam?

775
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:26,540
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

776
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:29,440
- We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
- Put it out, you fools!

777
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:33,540
- Put it out!
- That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

778
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:43,840
Go!

779
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,840
Back, you devils!

780
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:03,540
Frodo!

781
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,440
Oh, Sam.

782
01:14:46,540 --> 01:14:47,540
Strider!

783
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:55,540
- Help him, Strider.
- He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

784
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:01,940
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs elvish medicine.

785
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:07,740
Hurry!

786
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:11,840
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

787
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:13,940
Hold on, Frodo.

788
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:16,540
Gandalf!

789
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,740
Gwaihir - Go.

790
01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:57,640
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

791
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:02,640
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

792
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:07,340
Is he going to die?

793
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:12,340
He's passing into the shadow world.
He'll soon become a wraith like them.

794
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:21,340
- They're close.
- Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

795
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:23,140
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.

796
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:24,340
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

797
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:27,640
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

798
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:46,140
What's this, a ranger caught off his guard?

799
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:12,540
Frodo.

800
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:18,240
Im Arwen - Telin le thaed.
(l am Arwen - l've come to help you.)

801
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:23,640
Lasto beth n�n, tolo dan na ngalad.
(Hear my voice...come back to the light.)

802
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,840
Who is she?

803
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:33,240
Frodo.

804
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:36,940
- She's an elf.
- He's fading.

805
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:41,540
He's not going to last.

806
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:44,340
We must get him to my father.

807
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:47,940
- I've been looking for you for two days.
- Where are you taking him?

808
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:54,140
There are five wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

809
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:58,040
Dartho guin Berian. Rych le ad tolthathon.
(Stay with the Hobbits, l'll send horses for you.)

810
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:00,640
Hon mabathon. Rochon ellint im.
(l'm the faster rider, l'll take him.)

811
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:02,140
Andelu i ven.
(The Road is too dangerous.)

812
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:03,340
What are they saying?

813
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,440
Frodo f�r. Ae athradon i h�r...
(Frodo is dying. lf l can get across the river...)

814
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:09,040
...t�r gwaith n�n beriatha hon.
(...the power of my people will protect him.)

815
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:11,040
I do not fear them.

816
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:16,240
Be iest l�n.
(As you wish.)

817
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:22,440
Arwen...

818
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:25,640
...ride hard. Don't Look back.

819
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:35,040
What are you doing?!
Those wraiths are still out there!

820
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:47,540
Noro lim, Asfaloth!
(Ride fast Asfaloth!)

821
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:33,140
Give up the halfling, She-elf.

822
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:35,940
If you want him, come and claim him.

823
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,240
N�n o Chithaeglir...
(Waters of the Misty Mountains...)

824
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,640
...lasto beth daer
(...listen to the great word.)

825
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:53,640
Rimmo n�n Bruinen dan in Ulaer!
(Flow waters of loudwater against the ringwraiths)

826
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,240
N�n o Chithaeglir...
(Waters of the Misty Mountains...)

827
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,740
...lasto beth daer
(...listen to the great word.)

828
01:22:56,740 --> 01:23:00,640
Rimmo n�n Bruinen dan in Ulaer!
(Flow waters of loudwater against the ringwraiths)

829
01:23:29,940 --> 01:23:32,340
No. No!

830
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:37,840
Frodo, no.

831
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:40,340
Frodo, don't give in.

832
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:42,540
Not now.

833
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:56,040
What grace is given me...

834
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:58,540
...let it pass to him.

835
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:00,940
Let him be spared.

836
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,540
Save him.

837
01:24:05,740 --> 01:24:09,740
Lasto beth n�n, tolo dan na ngalad.
(Hear my voice...come back to the light.)

838
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:21,040
- Where am I?
- You are in the house of Elrond.

839
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:27,840
And it is 10 o'clock in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

840
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:33,740
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

841
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:38,540
And you're lucky to be here too.

842
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:43,140
A few more hours and you would
have been beyond our aid.

843
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:47,440
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

844
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,640
What happened, Gandalf?

845
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:03,940
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.

846
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:10,440
I was delayed.

847
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:15,540
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

848
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:24,340
One ill turn deserves another. It is over.

849
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,440
Embrace the power of the ring...

850
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:30,540
...or embrace your own destruction!

851
01:25:32,940 --> 01:25:36,640
There is only one lord of the ring.

852
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:40,940
Only one who can bend it to his will.

853
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:45,740
And he does not share power.

854
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:03,340
So you have chosen...death.

855
01:26:13,640 --> 01:26:17,240
Gandalf? What is it?

856
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,140
Nothing, Frodo.

857
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,740
Frodo!

858
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:26,340
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

859
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:29,340
Sam has hardly left your side.

860
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:31,740
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

861
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:37,240
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

862
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:42,340
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

863
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:33,640
- Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

864
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:35,740
Bilbo.

865
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:42,640
There and back again

866
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:45,340
A hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins.''

867
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:51,940
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

868
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:56,040
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

869
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:58,840
...visit Lake-town...

870
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:02,440
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

871
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:07,740
But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.

872
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:21,840
I miss the Shire.

873
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:27,240
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

874
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:31,140
Off with you, on one of your adventures.

875
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:37,640
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

876
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:46,140
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

877
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:49,640
My dear boy.

878
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:57,640
- Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

879
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:00,240
No harm in being prepared.

880
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:03,040
- I thought you wanted to see the elves.
- I do.

881
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:06,040
- More than anything.
- I did.

882
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,340
It's just....

883
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:11,640
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

884
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:15,440
We got the ring this far, to Rivendell.
And I thought...

885
01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:19,040
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

886
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:20,940
Off home.

887
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:27,040
You are right, Sam.

888
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:32,040
We did what we set out to do.

889
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:35,140
The ring will be safe in Rivendell.

890
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:41,640
I am ready to go home.

891
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:44,340
His strength returns.

892
01:29:44,640 --> 01:29:50,140
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

893
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,440
And yet to have come so far still bearing the ring...

894
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:57,240
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

895
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:00,940
It is a burden he should never have had to bear.

896
01:30:01,240 --> 01:30:06,440
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

897
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:11,340
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His eye is fixed on Rivendell.

898
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:14,340
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

899
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:17,840
Our list of allies grows thin.

900
01:30:18,640 --> 01:30:21,340
His treachery runs deeper than you know.

901
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:25,140
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed orcs with goblin-men.

902
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:27,840
He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard.

903
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:32,640
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

904
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:35,340
Saruman is coming for the ring.

905
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:39,740
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the elves.

906
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:44,340
We do not have the strength to
fight both Mordor and Isengard!

907
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:49,340
Gandalf...

908
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:53,140
...the ring cannot stay here.

909
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:15,940
This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.

910
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:18,940
They must decide now how to end it.

911
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:23,440
The time of the elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

912
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:27,740
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The dwarves?

913
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:33,040
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.

914
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:37,540
It is in men that we must place our hope.

915
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,640
Men?

916
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:43,640
Men are weak. The race of men is failing.

917
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:48,240
The blood of Numenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

918
01:31:48,740 --> 01:31:52,140
It is because of men the ring survives.

919
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:54,040
I was there, Gandalf.

920
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:57,540
I was there 3000 years ago...

921
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:06,740
... when Isildur took the ring.

922
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,740
I was there the day the strength of men failed.

923
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,940
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

924
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:21,140
I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom...

925
01:32:21,540 --> 01:32:24,940
...where the ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

926
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:27,640
Cast it into the fire!

927
01:32:32,940 --> 01:32:36,540
- Destroy it!
- No.

928
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:40,140
Isildur!

929
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:45,240
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

930
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:53,640
Isildur kept the ring.
The line of kings is broken.

931
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:58,240
There's no strength left in the world of men.

932
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:03,240
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

933
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:06,840
One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.

934
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:12,340
He turned from that path a long time ago.

935
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:14,740
He has chosen exile.

936
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,740
You are no elf.

937
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:50,040
Men of the South are welcome here.

938
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:54,140
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

939
01:33:55,740 --> 01:33:58,440
Then we are here on common purpose...

940
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:00,240
...friend.

941
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:18,440
The shards of Narsil.

942
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:26,240
The blade that cut the ring from Sauron's hand.

943
01:34:29,340 --> 01:34:31,540
It's still sharp.

944
01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:43,440
But no more than a broken heirloom.

945
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:13,440
Why do you fear the past?

946
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:19,440
You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himseIf.

947
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:23,240
You are not bound to his fate.

948
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:27,640
The same blood flows in my veins.

949
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:33,340
The same weakness.

950
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:38,840
Your time will come.

951
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:43,340
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

952
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:49,340
A si i-Dhuath �-orthor, Aragorn.
(The shadow does not hold sway yet, Aragorn)

953
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:53,640
� or le a � or nin.
(Not over you, not over me.)

954
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:08,740
Renich i l� i erui govannem?
(Do you remember when we first met?)

955
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:15,540
Nauthannen i ned �l reniannen.
(I thought I had strayed into a dream.)

956
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:19,140
Gwenwin in enninath.
(Long years have passed.)

957
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:23,840
�-'arnech in naeth i si celich.
(You did not wear the troubles you carry now.)

958
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,140
Renech i beth i pennen?
(Do you remember what I told you?)

959
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:36,640
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

960
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:43,540
...forsaking the immortal life of your people.

961
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:46,740
And to that I hold.

962
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:50,440
I would rather share one lifetime with you...

963
01:36:50,940 --> 01:36:54,540
...than face all the ages of this world alone.

964
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:06,740
I choose a mortal life.

965
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:12,340
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

966
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:18,140
...like my heart.

967
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:37,640
Strangers from distant lands, friends of old...

968
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:41,740
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

969
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:47,240
Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction.
None can escape it.

970
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:51,040
You will unite, or you will fall.

971
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:55,540
Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom.

972
01:37:57,540 --> 01:38:00,840
Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

973
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:16,740
So it is true.

974
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:28,040
The ring of power...

975
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:31,640
The doom of men...

976
01:38:34,240 --> 01:38:36,240
In a dream...

977
01:38:38,040 --> 01:38:41,140
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

978
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,140
...but in the West a pale light lingered.

979
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:45,740
A voice was crying:

980
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:48,840
"Your doom is near at hand.

981
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:52,640
Isildur's bane is found."

982
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:58,440
Isildur s bane.

983
01:38:59,040 --> 01:38:59,340
Boromir!

984
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:02,740
"Ash nazg durbatul�k...
("One ring to rule them all...)

985
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:06,540
...Ash nazg gimbatul...
(...One ring to find them...)

986
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:10,140
...Ash nazg thrakatul�k...
(...One ring to bring them all...)

987
01:39:12,940 --> 01:39:17,440
...agh burzum-ishi krimpatul."
(...and in the darkness bind them.")

988
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:27,240
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

989
01:39:27,640 --> 01:39:31,140
I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond...

990
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,440
...for the black speech of Mordor...

991
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,140
...may yet be heard...

992
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:38,240
...in every corner of the West!

993
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:41,140
The ring is altogether evil.

994
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:43,040
It is a gift.

995
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,740
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

996
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,440
Why not use this ring?

997
01:39:48,740 --> 01:39:51,440
Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor...

998
01:39:51,740 --> 01:39:55,840
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

999
01:39:56,340 --> 01:39:58,440
...are your lands kept safe.

1000
01:40:00,240 --> 01:40:04,440
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

1001
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:08,440
You cannot wield it. None of us can.

1002
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:13,140
The one ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

1003
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:16,940
And what would a ranger know of this matter?

1004
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:19,140
This is no mere ranger.

1005
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:23,740
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

1006
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:27,240
You owe him your allegiance.

1007
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,340
Aragorn.

1008
01:40:35,140 --> 01:40:37,940
This is Isildur s heir?

1009
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:43,040
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

1010
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:46,840
Havo dad, Legolas.
(Sit down, Legolas.)

1011
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:52,740
Gondor has no king.

1012
01:40:54,740 --> 01:40:56,340
Gondor needs no king.

1013
01:41:03,040 --> 01:41:06,540
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

1014
01:41:07,740 --> 01:41:11,040
You have only one choice.

1015
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:13,640
The ring must be destroyed.

1016
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:21,440
What are we waiting for?

1017
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:36,540
The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin...

1018
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:41,040
...by any craft that we here possess.

1019
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:45,640
The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.

1020
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:49,740
Only there can it be unmade.

1021
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:53,440
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

1022
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:58,040
...and cast back into the fiery
chasm from whence it came.

1023
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:00,540
Ash Nazg Durbatuluk...
(One ring to rule them all...)

1024
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:02,640
One of you...

1025
01:42:03,240 --> 01:42:05,340
...must do this.

1026
01:42:08,340 --> 01:42:11,940
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

1027
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:16,440
Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs.

1028
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:21,340
There is evil there that does not sleep.

1029
01:42:21,740 --> 01:42:25,840
The great eye is ever-watchful.

1030
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:28,640
It is a barren wasteland...

1031
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:32,340
...riddled with fire, and ash and dust.

1032
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:36,540
The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.

1033
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:40,940
Not with 10,000 men could you do this.
It is folly.

1034
01:42:41,340 --> 01:42:45,640
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said?
The ring must be destroyed.

1035
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:48,440
And I suppose you think you are the one to do it!

1036
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:53,240
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

1037
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:58,740
I will be dead before I see the
ring in the hands of an elf!

1038
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:03,340
Never trust an elf!

1039
01:43:04,640 --> 01:43:10,240
Do you not understand? While you bicker
amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

1040
01:43:10,740 --> 01:43:13,540
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1041
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:16,940
Ash Nazg Durbatuluk
(One ring to rule them all...)

1042
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:19,440
...Ash nazg gimbatul...
(...One ring to find them...)

1043
01:43:19,440 --> 01:43:21,540
Ash Nazg Durbatuluk...
(One ring to rule them all...)

1044
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:23,540
...Ash nazg gimbatul...
(...One ring to find them...)

1045
01:43:23,540 --> 01:43:25,540
Ash Nazg Durbatuluk...
(One ring to rule them all...)

1046
01:43:25,540 --> 01:43:27,740
...Ash nazg gimbatul...
(...One ring to find them...)

1047
01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:29,840
Ash Nazg Durbatuluk...
(One ring to rule them all...)

1048
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:34,340
I will take it.

1049
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:39,140
I will take it.

1050
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:47,940
I will take the ring to Mordor.

1051
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:57,340
Though...

1052
01:44:00,540 --> 01:44:02,340
...I do not know the way.

1053
01:44:04,340 --> 01:44:08,440
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins...

1054
01:44:08,840 --> 01:44:12,140
...as long as it is yours to bear.

1055
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:16,340
If by my life or death I can protect you...

1056
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:18,440
...I will.

1057
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:23,940
You have my sword.

1058
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,840
And you have my bow.

1059
01:44:28,540 --> 01:44:30,840
And my ax.

1060
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:40,840
You carry the fates of us all, little one.

1061
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:46,540
If this is indeed the will of the Council...

1062
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:49,640
...then Gondor will see it done.

1063
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:56,840
- Mr. Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- No indeed it is hardly possible to separate you...

1064
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:01,940
...even when he is summoned to a
secret council and you are not.

1065
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:04,440
Oy. We're coming too!

1066
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:09,340
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1067
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:12,740
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

1068
01:45:13,240 --> 01:45:14,440
...mission.

1069
01:45:14,440 --> 01:45:15,990
Quest.

1070
01:45:16,490 --> 01:45:17,490
Thing.

1071
01:45:19,290 --> 01:45:21,990
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1072
01:45:23,690 --> 01:45:25,490
Nine companions.

1073
01:45:27,290 --> 01:45:29,090
So be it.

1074
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:32,490
You shall be: The Fellowship of the Ring.

1075
01:45:33,190 --> 01:45:34,990
Great!

1076
01:45:35,390 --> 01:45:37,490
Where are we going?

1077
01:46:13,390 --> 01:46:16,390
Anirne hene beriad i chen l�n.
(She wanted to protect her child.)

1078
01:46:17,690 --> 01:46:21,090
Ned Imladris nauthant e le beriathar aen.
(She thought in Rivendell you would be safe.)

1079
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:27,490
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted all your life.

1080
01:46:28,090 --> 01:46:29,790
That you'd never escape your fate.

1081
01:46:30,290 --> 01:46:33,690
The skill of the elves can reforge
the sword of kings...

1082
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:38,090
...but only you have the power to wield it.

1083
01:46:39,290 --> 01:46:41,690
I do not want that power.

1084
01:46:41,990 --> 01:46:44,590
I have never wanted it.

1085
01:46:45,890 --> 01:46:48,390
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

1086
01:46:53,090 --> 01:46:55,290
My old sword! Sting.

1087
01:46:55,690 --> 01:46:56,790
Here, take it. Take it.

1088
01:47:02,190 --> 01:47:05,990
- It's so light.
- Yes, yeah. Made by the elves, you know.

1089
01:47:06,790 --> 01:47:10,790
The blade glows blue when orcs are close.

1090
01:47:11,290 --> 01:47:15,690
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

1091
01:47:15,990 --> 01:47:18,390
Here's a pretty thing.

1092
01:47:18,890 --> 01:47:20,090
Mithril.

1093
01:47:20,990 --> 01:47:25,190
As light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales.

1094
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:28,690
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1095
01:47:36,890 --> 01:47:38,890
My old ring.

1096
01:47:40,190 --> 01:47:43,990
I should very much like...

1097
01:47:44,390 --> 01:47:48,190
...to hold it again, one last time.

1098
01:48:05,690 --> 01:48:09,190
I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy.

1099
01:48:09,690 --> 01:48:13,590
I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.

1100
01:48:18,390 --> 01:48:21,290
I'm sorry for everything.

1101
01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:40,490
The ring-bearer is setting out
on the quest of Mount Doom.

1102
01:48:41,890 --> 01:48:44,390
On you who travel with him, no oath...

1103
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:47,790
...nor bond is laid to go further than you will.

1104
01:48:51,290 --> 01:48:53,690
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1105
01:48:54,190 --> 01:48:57,990
May the blessings of elves and men...

1106
01:48:58,790 --> 01:49:01,290
...and all free folk go with you.

1107
01:49:04,390 --> 01:49:08,290
The fellowship awaits the ring-bearer.

1108
01:49:26,990 --> 01:49:29,390
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1109
01:49:29,990 --> 01:49:31,790
Left.

1110
01:50:51,490 --> 01:50:55,590
We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

1111
01:50:56,090 --> 01:50:59,590
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

1112
01:51:00,090 --> 01:51:03,590
From there, our road turns east to Mordor.

1113
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:07,490
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1114
01:51:09,490 --> 01:51:10,490
Move your feet.

1115
01:51:10,490 --> 01:51:11,990
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

1116
01:51:12,290 --> 01:51:13,690
Faster!

1117
01:51:14,990 --> 01:51:18,690
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

1118
01:51:18,990 --> 01:51:21,590
...I'd say we were taking the long way 'round.

1119
01:51:22,290 --> 01:51:25,190
Gandalf.
We could pass through the mines of Moria.

1120
01:51:25,890 --> 01:51:29,590
My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.

1121
01:51:29,990 --> 01:51:35,190
No Gimli, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1122
01:51:44,690 --> 01:51:45,790
Sorry!

1123
01:51:46,490 --> 01:51:47,990
Get him!

1124
01:51:49,490 --> 01:51:51,790
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

1125
01:51:52,490 --> 01:51:54,690
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1126
01:51:58,590 --> 01:52:00,090
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1127
01:52:00,590 --> 01:52:03,190
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1128
01:52:03,590 --> 01:52:06,090
It's moving fast.

1129
01:52:06,490 --> 01:52:08,590
Against the wind.

1130
01:52:09,390 --> 01:52:11,490
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

1131
01:52:11,790 --> 01:52:14,390
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

1132
01:52:47,990 --> 01:52:49,590
Spies of Saruman.

1133
01:52:50,390 --> 01:52:53,490
The passage south is being watched.

1134
01:52:54,790 --> 01:52:58,090
We must take the pass of Caradhras.

1135
01:53:10,690 --> 01:53:12,290
Frodo!

1136
01:53:31,390 --> 01:53:33,590
Boromir.

1137
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:38,090
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1138
01:53:38,090 --> 01:53:41,290
...over so small a thing.

1139
01:53:44,690 --> 01:53:46,590
Such a little thing.

1140
01:53:46,890 --> 01:53:48,290
Boromir!

1141
01:53:48,990 --> 01:53:51,490
Give the ring to Frodo.

1142
01:54:01,490 --> 01:54:03,390
As you wish.

1143
01:54:04,190 --> 01:54:06,190
I care not.

1144
01:54:41,590 --> 01:54:46,090
So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras.

1145
01:54:46,490 --> 01:54:50,990
And if that fails, where then will you go?

1146
01:54:52,490 --> 01:54:55,290
If the mountain defeats you...

1147
01:54:55,590 --> 01:54:59,890
... will you risk a more dangerous road?

1148
01:55:05,190 --> 01:55:12,190
Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse!
(Wake up cruel Redhorn!)

1149
01:55:12,490 --> 01:55:15,190
There is a fell voice on the air.

1150
01:55:15,190 --> 01:55:16,390
Nai yarvaxea rasselya!
(May your horn be bloodstained!)

1151
01:55:16,390 --> 01:55:17,890
It's Saruman!

1152
01:55:26,890 --> 01:55:31,290
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

1153
01:55:31,690 --> 01:55:33,490
No!

1154
01:55:35,590 --> 01:55:41,590
Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho i 'ruith!
(Sleep Caradhras, be still, lie still, hold your wrath!)

1155
01:55:41,890 --> 01:55:46,890
Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse!
(Wake up cruel Redhorn!)

1156
01:55:46,890 --> 01:55:51,390
Nai yarvaxea rasselya...
(May your bloodstained horn...)

1157
01:55:51,390 --> 01:55:55,090
...taltuva notto-carinnar!
(...fall upon enemy heads!)

1158
01:56:39,990 --> 01:56:41,790
We must get off the mountain!

1159
01:56:42,290 --> 01:56:46,490
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1160
01:56:46,890 --> 01:56:50,090
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!

1161
01:56:50,390 --> 01:56:53,990
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1162
01:56:54,390 --> 01:56:57,090
Let us go through the mines of Moria.

1163
01:56:58,990 --> 01:57:02,590
Moria. You fear to go into those mines.

1164
01:57:03,490 --> 01:57:08,290
The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.

1165
01:57:09,390 --> 01:57:14,090
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-d�m:

1166
01:57:15,490 --> 01:57:18,790
Shadow and flame.

1167
01:57:22,390 --> 01:57:24,990
Let the ring-bearer decide.

1168
01:57:29,790 --> 01:57:31,890
We cannot stay here!

1169
01:57:31,890 --> 01:57:34,790
This will be the death of the hobbits.

1170
01:57:35,090 --> 01:57:36,690
Frodo?

1171
01:57:39,790 --> 01:57:42,490
We will go through the mines.

1172
01:57:43,490 --> 01:57:45,290
So be it.

1173
01:57:51,990 --> 01:57:55,690
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1174
01:57:59,390 --> 01:58:01,490
How is your shoulder?

1175
01:58:01,790 --> 01:58:04,890
- Better than it was.
- And the ring?

1176
01:58:06,590 --> 01:58:09,090
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1177
01:58:09,590 --> 01:58:12,390
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1178
01:58:12,990 --> 01:58:16,690
Evil will be drawn to you from
outside the fellowship.

1179
01:58:16,990 --> 01:58:19,490
And, I fear, from within.

1180
01:58:22,290 --> 01:58:26,290
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

1181
01:58:26,590 --> 01:58:29,290
Trust your own strengths.

1182
01:58:29,690 --> 01:58:32,190
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

1183
01:58:32,190 --> 01:58:34,390
...for good or for evil.

1184
01:58:34,690 --> 01:58:36,890
Some are greater than I am.

1185
01:58:37,490 --> 01:58:40,890
And against some I have not yet been tested.

1186
01:58:42,490 --> 01:58:43,790
The walls...

1187
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:46,590
...of Moria.

1188
01:58:52,390 --> 01:58:55,290
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1189
01:58:55,590 --> 01:58:59,790
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1190
01:59:00,390 --> 01:59:02,790
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1191
01:59:10,790 --> 01:59:13,990
Well, let's see.

1192
01:59:14,390 --> 01:59:15,790
Ithildin.

1193
01:59:16,490 --> 01:59:19,690
It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.

1194
01:59:33,890 --> 01:59:38,290
It reads; "The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.

1195
01:59:38,590 --> 01:59:43,290
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

1196
01:59:43,290 --> 01:59:47,990
Oh It's quite simple. If you are a friend,
you speak the password and the doors will open.

1197
01:59:48,690 --> 01:59:53,790
Annon Edhellen, edro hi ammen!
(Gate of the elves, open now for me!)

1198
02:00:04,490 --> 02:00:08,390
...lasto beth lammen.
(...listen to the word of my tongue.)

1199
02:00:11,890 --> 02:00:12,890
Nothing's happening.

1200
02:00:20,090 --> 02:00:24,090
I once knew every spell in
all the tongues of elves...

1201
02:00:24,590 --> 02:00:27,290
...men and orcs.

1202
02:00:27,590 --> 02:00:28,790
What are you going to do, then?

1203
02:00:28,790 --> 02:00:31,190
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

1204
02:00:31,490 --> 02:00:33,390
And if that does not shatter them...

1205
02:00:33,690 --> 02:00:36,290
...and I am allowed a little
peace from foolish questions...

1206
02:00:36,590 --> 02:00:39,890
...I will try to find the opening words.

1207
02:00:43,490 --> 02:00:45,490
Ando Eldarinwa...
(Gate of elves...)

1208
02:00:47,190 --> 02:00:49,690
...a lasta quettanya...
(...listen to my word...)

1209
02:00:50,190 --> 02:00:52,390
...Fenda Casarinwa...
(...threshold of dwarves...)

1210
02:00:52,890 --> 02:00:55,290
Mines are no place for a pony.

1211
02:00:55,690 --> 02:00:59,490
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye-bye, Bill.

1212
02:00:59,490 --> 02:01:00,890
Fennas Nogothrim...
(Doorway of the dwarf-folk...)

1213
02:01:00,890 --> 02:01:03,590
Go on, Bill. Go on.

1214
02:01:04,290 --> 02:01:07,790
Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home.

1215
02:01:14,690 --> 02:01:17,090
Do not disturb the water.

1216
02:01:17,390 --> 02:01:19,290
Oh, it's useless.

1217
02:01:31,990 --> 02:01:34,090
It's a riddle.

1218
02:01:36,890 --> 02:01:39,990
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1219
02:01:40,490 --> 02:01:43,290
What's the elvish word for "friend"?

1220
02:01:44,690 --> 02:01:45,990
Mellon.

1221
02:02:04,090 --> 02:02:08,790
Soon, master elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the dwarves.

1222
02:02:09,390 --> 02:02:14,890
Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone!

1223
02:02:16,690 --> 02:02:19,590
This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin.

1224
02:02:20,190 --> 02:02:22,490
And they call it a mine.

1225
02:02:22,490 --> 02:02:24,590
A mine!

1226
02:02:25,790 --> 02:02:28,890
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1227
02:02:35,190 --> 02:02:36,690
No....

1228
02:02:37,990 --> 02:02:39,590
No!

1229
02:02:42,390 --> 02:02:43,790
Goblins.

1230
02:02:47,790 --> 02:02:51,890
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1231
02:02:53,090 --> 02:02:55,590
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1232
02:02:58,490 --> 02:03:00,790
- Frodo!
- Help!

1233
02:03:01,190 --> 02:03:02,690
Strider!

1234
02:03:02,690 --> 02:03:05,490
- Help!
- Get off him!

1235
02:03:05,790 --> 02:03:06,790
Aragorn!

1236
02:03:17,290 --> 02:03:18,290
Frodo!

1237
02:03:44,590 --> 02:03:45,690
Into the mines!

1238
02:03:45,690 --> 02:03:48,990
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

1239
02:03:53,390 --> 02:03:55,090
Run!

1240
02:04:12,090 --> 02:04:15,590
We now have but one choice.

1241
02:04:15,890 --> 02:04:20,490
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1242
02:04:20,990 --> 02:04:22,890
Be on your guard.

1243
02:04:23,190 --> 02:04:26,490
There are older and fouler things than orcs...

1244
02:04:26,890 --> 02:04:30,190
...in the deep places of the world.

1245
02:04:38,290 --> 02:04:41,990
Quietly now.
It's a four-day journey to the other side.

1246
02:04:42,490 --> 02:04:46,090
Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.

1247
02:05:31,990 --> 02:05:35,590
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

1248
02:05:35,990 --> 02:05:38,290
...or jewels...

1249
02:05:38,290 --> 02:05:41,490
...but mithril.

1250
02:05:59,990 --> 02:06:04,590
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

1251
02:06:05,090 --> 02:06:08,890
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

1252
02:06:08,890 --> 02:06:10,990
I never told him...

1253
02:06:11,290 --> 02:06:15,990
...but its worth was greater
than the value of the Shire.

1254
02:06:28,490 --> 02:06:30,190
Pippin.

1255
02:06:50,590 --> 02:06:53,390
I have no memory of this place.

1256
02:06:55,590 --> 02:06:56,990
- Are we Lost?
- No.

1257
02:06:57,290 --> 02:06:59,690
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

1258
02:06:59,990 --> 02:07:01,390
- Merry?
- What?

1259
02:07:01,690 --> 02:07:03,490
I'm hungry.

1260
02:07:14,990 --> 02:07:19,190
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.

1261
02:07:19,590 --> 02:07:23,490
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

1262
02:07:23,990 --> 02:07:27,990
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-d�r?
- Escaped...

1263
02:07:28,790 --> 02:07:30,390
...or was set loose.

1264
02:07:30,990 --> 02:07:34,490
Now the ring has brought him here.

1265
02:07:37,190 --> 02:07:39,890
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1266
02:07:40,290 --> 02:07:45,690
He hates and loves the ring,
as he hates and loves himseIf.

1267
02:07:46,090 --> 02:07:50,790
Smeagol's life is a sad story.

1268
02:07:51,190 --> 02:07:56,890
Yes, Smeagol he was once called.
Before the ring found him.

1269
02:07:58,090 --> 02:08:00,790
Before it drove him mad.

1270
02:08:01,090 --> 02:08:03,890
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1271
02:08:04,190 --> 02:08:05,290
Pity?

1272
02:08:06,390 --> 02:08:09,290
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1273
02:08:10,290 --> 02:08:15,290
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1274
02:08:16,990 --> 02:08:19,390
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1275
02:08:21,890 --> 02:08:25,690
Do not be too eager to deal
out death and judgment.

1276
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:28,790
Even the very wise cannot see all ends.

1277
02:08:29,490 --> 02:08:35,190
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1278
02:08:36,290 --> 02:08:38,990
...before this is over.

1279
02:08:40,590 --> 02:08:44,290
The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

1280
02:08:51,190 --> 02:08:54,390
I wish the ring had never come to me.

1281
02:08:55,890 --> 02:08:57,890
I wish none of this had happened.

1282
02:08:57,890 --> 02:09:02,890
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1283
02:09:03,990 --> 02:09:09,290
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1284
02:09:10,990 --> 02:09:14,790
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1285
02:09:15,390 --> 02:09:17,790
Bilbo was meant to find the ring.

1286
02:09:18,290 --> 02:09:22,490
In which case, you also were meant to have it.

1287
02:09:22,890 --> 02:09:25,890
And that is an encouraging thought.

1288
02:09:30,890 --> 02:09:32,790
It's that way.

1289
02:09:33,090 --> 02:09:35,290
- He's remembered.
- No.

1290
02:09:35,590 --> 02:09:39,190
But the air doesn't smell so foul down here.

1291
02:09:39,490 --> 02:09:44,490
If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.

1292
02:09:59,590 --> 02:10:03,590
Let me risk a little more light.

1293
02:10:08,390 --> 02:10:10,390
Behold...

1294
02:10:10,890 --> 02:10:15,990
...the great realm and dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1295
02:10:18,590 --> 02:10:21,890
Now there's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1296
02:10:46,990 --> 02:10:48,690
Gimli!

1297
02:10:56,090 --> 02:10:57,690
No!

1298
02:11:00,290 --> 02:11:03,390
Oh, no.

1299
02:11:05,290 --> 02:11:06,490
No.

1300
02:11:13,890 --> 02:11:15,790
"Here lies Balin...

1301
02:11:16,290 --> 02:11:18,290
...son of Fundin...

1302
02:11:18,690 --> 02:11:21,190
...Lord of Moria."

1303
02:11:22,290 --> 02:11:23,890
He is dead, then.

1304
02:11:25,790 --> 02:11:27,390
It's as I feared.

1305
02:11:45,690 --> 02:11:48,490
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1306
02:11:48,790 --> 02:11:53,290
"They have taken the bridge and the second hall.

1307
02:11:54,590 --> 02:11:57,090
We have barred the gates...

1308
02:11:57,790 --> 02:12:00,190
...but cannot hold them for long.

1309
02:12:00,490 --> 02:12:03,190
The ground shakes.

1310
02:12:03,790 --> 02:12:05,190
Drums...

1311
02:12:05,690 --> 02:12:08,890
...drums in the deep.

1312
02:12:12,690 --> 02:12:14,590
We cannot get out.

1313
02:12:16,690 --> 02:12:20,390
A shadow moves in the dark.

1314
02:12:22,190 --> 02:12:24,690
We cannot get out.

1315
02:12:27,790 --> 02:12:29,590
They are coming."

1316
02:13:12,790 --> 02:13:14,590
Fool of a Took!

1317
02:13:14,890 --> 02:13:18,590
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1318
02:13:44,790 --> 02:13:46,390
Frodo!

1319
02:13:48,790 --> 02:13:50,190
Orcs.

1320
02:13:57,290 --> 02:13:59,190
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1321
02:14:06,490 --> 02:14:08,190
They have a cave-troll.

1322
02:14:23,990 --> 02:14:25,190
Let them come!

1323
02:14:25,590 --> 02:14:28,990
There is one dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1324
02:16:48,090 --> 02:16:50,790
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1325
02:16:55,590 --> 02:16:57,290
Frodo!

1326
02:17:30,790 --> 02:17:32,590
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1327
02:17:33,690 --> 02:17:35,490
Frodo!

1328
02:18:20,690 --> 02:18:22,590
Frodo!

1329
02:19:22,890 --> 02:19:24,190
Oh, no.

1330
02:19:32,590 --> 02:19:34,390
He's alive.

1331
02:19:36,990 --> 02:19:39,790
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1332
02:19:40,090 --> 02:19:42,190
You should be dead.

1333
02:19:42,590 --> 02:19:44,890
That spear would have skewered a wild boar.

1334
02:19:45,190 --> 02:19:49,790
I think there's more to this
hobbit than meets the eye.

1335
02:19:55,790 --> 02:19:56,890
Mithril.

1336
02:19:59,690 --> 02:20:02,190
You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.

1337
02:20:08,190 --> 02:20:09,990
To the bridge of Khazad-d�m!

1338
02:20:25,190 --> 02:20:26,790
This way!

1339
02:21:37,290 --> 02:21:40,090
What is this new devilry?

1340
02:21:56,290 --> 02:21:59,090
A Balrog.

1341
02:21:59,390 --> 02:22:02,490
A demon of the ancient world.

1342
02:22:04,790 --> 02:22:07,090
This foe is beyond any of you.

1343
02:22:08,390 --> 02:22:09,890
Run!

1344
02:22:17,190 --> 02:22:18,690
Quickly!

1345
02:22:35,390 --> 02:22:36,690
Gandalf.

1346
02:22:37,290 --> 02:22:38,790
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1347
02:22:40,290 --> 02:22:42,790
The bridge is near.

1348
02:22:44,790 --> 02:22:48,790
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1349
02:23:17,990 --> 02:23:19,690
Gandalf!

1350
02:23:38,090 --> 02:23:39,290
Merry! Pippin!

1351
02:23:50,490 --> 02:23:51,890
Sam!

1352
02:23:54,690 --> 02:23:57,790
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1353
02:24:00,990 --> 02:24:02,390
Not the beard!

1354
02:24:15,690 --> 02:24:17,590
Steady.

1355
02:24:19,590 --> 02:24:21,190
Hold on!

1356
02:24:42,390 --> 02:24:43,590
Hang on!

1357
02:24:54,290 --> 02:24:55,990
Lean forward!

1358
02:24:59,090 --> 02:24:59,990
Steady.

1359
02:25:01,390 --> 02:25:02,490
Come on!

1360
02:25:02,790 --> 02:25:04,190
Now!

1361
02:25:21,390 --> 02:25:23,090
Over the bridge!

1362
02:25:23,390 --> 02:25:24,890
Fly!

1363
02:26:09,590 --> 02:26:11,590
You cannot pass!

1364
02:26:11,890 --> 02:26:13,490
Gandalf!

1365
02:26:17,790 --> 02:26:22,490
I am a servant of the secret fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1366
02:26:23,590 --> 02:26:27,290
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Ud�n!

1367
02:26:37,490 --> 02:26:39,390
Go back to the Shadow.

1368
02:26:47,290 --> 02:26:51,490
YOU - SHALL NOT - PASS!

1369
02:27:18,790 --> 02:27:22,490
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

1370
02:27:30,290 --> 02:27:32,690
Fly, you fools!

1371
02:27:36,890 --> 02:27:38,990
No!

1372
02:27:45,190 --> 02:27:47,290
Aragorn!

1373
02:28:44,790 --> 02:28:47,490
Legolas, get them up.

1374
02:28:51,590 --> 02:28:53,390
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1375
02:28:53,690 --> 02:28:57,190
By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with orcs.

1376
02:28:57,590 --> 02:29:00,690
We must reach the woods of Lothl�rien.

1377
02:29:01,790 --> 02:29:04,990
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1378
02:29:06,690 --> 02:29:08,790
On your feet, Sam.

1379
02:29:09,190 --> 02:29:10,590
Frodo?

1380
02:29:12,690 --> 02:29:14,290
Frodo!

1381
02:30:06,890 --> 02:30:09,290
Stay close, young hobbits!

1382
02:30:10,190 --> 02:30:14,190
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1383
02:30:14,490 --> 02:30:16,890
An elf-witch...

1384
02:30:17,690 --> 02:30:20,390
...of terrible power.

1385
02:30:21,090 --> 02:30:23,190
All who look upon her...

1386
02:30:23,190 --> 02:30:25,190
...fall under her spell.

1387
02:30:25,490 --> 02:30:26,690
Frodo!

1388
02:30:28,990 --> 02:30:30,990
And are never seen again.

1389
02:30:30,990 --> 02:30:35,490
Your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom.

1390
02:30:35,890 --> 02:30:39,490
You bring great evil here, ring-bearer.

1391
02:30:39,890 --> 02:30:41,490
Mr. Frodo?

1392
02:30:46,990 --> 02:30:52,390
Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily.

1393
02:30:52,690 --> 02:30:57,090
I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.

1394
02:31:04,890 --> 02:31:09,290
The dwarf breathes so loud, we
could have shot him in the dark.

1395
02:31:13,590 --> 02:31:16,790
Mae govannen, Legolas Thranduilion.
(Welcome, Legolas son of Thranduil.)

1396
02:31:17,490 --> 02:31:19,090
Govannas v�n gwennen le,
(Our fellowship stands in your debt,)

1397
02:31:19,090 --> 02:31:20,990
Haldir o L�rien.
(Haldir of L�rien.)

1398
02:31:22,690 --> 02:31:24,790
A, Aragorn in D�nedain...
(Oh, Aragorn of the D�nedain...)

1399
02:31:24,790 --> 02:31:27,290
...istannen le ammen.
(...you are known to us.)

1400
02:31:27,290 --> 02:31:28,090
Haldir.

1401
02:31:28,090 --> 02:31:29,790
So much for the legendary courtesy of the elves!

1402
02:31:30,090 --> 02:31:31,990
Speak words we can all understand!

1403
02:31:31,990 --> 02:31:36,590
We have not had dealings with
the dwarves since the dark days.

1404
02:31:36,990 --> 02:31:39,390
And you know what this dwarf says to that?

1405
02:31:39,790 --> 02:31:44,390
Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul!
(I spit upon your grave!)

1406
02:31:46,390 --> 02:31:48,290
That was not so courteous.

1407
02:31:54,890 --> 02:31:58,790
You bring great evil with you.

1408
02:32:00,790 --> 02:32:02,890
You can go no further.

1409
02:32:09,090 --> 02:32:11,990
Boe ammen veriad l�n. Andelu i ven!
(We need your protection. The road is fell!)

1410
02:32:14,890 --> 02:32:16,190
Merin le telim.
(I wish we may come with you.)

1411
02:32:16,590 --> 02:32:18,390
Henio, an�ron boe ammen i dulu l�n!
(Please, understand, we need your support!)

1412
02:32:19,790 --> 02:32:22,590
Aragorn!

1413
02:32:33,090 --> 02:32:35,090
Merin le telim.
(I wish we may come with you.)

1414
02:32:37,790 --> 02:32:39,290
Andelu i ven.
(The road is very dangerous.)

1415
02:32:40,290 --> 02:32:42,790
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1416
02:32:44,090 --> 02:32:45,890
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1417
02:32:47,490 --> 02:32:50,690
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1418
02:32:51,790 --> 02:32:54,790
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1419
02:32:57,690 --> 02:32:59,690
You will follow me.

1420
02:33:11,490 --> 02:33:13,390
Cares Galeton.

1421
02:33:13,990 --> 02:33:16,890
The heart of Elvendom on earth.

1422
02:33:16,890 --> 02:33:22,590
Realm of the Lord Celeborn
and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

1423
02:34:41,990 --> 02:34:44,890
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1424
02:34:45,690 --> 02:34:50,590
What hope you had in secrecy is now gone.

1425
02:34:52,590 --> 02:34:56,790
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

1426
02:34:57,290 --> 02:34:59,090
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1427
02:34:59,090 --> 02:35:02,290
For I much desire to speak with him.

1428
02:35:02,590 --> 02:35:05,190
I can no longer see him from afar.

1429
02:35:06,290 --> 02:35:11,190
Gandalf the Grey did not pass
the borders of this land.

1430
02:35:11,690 --> 02:35:13,990
He has fallen into shadow.

1431
02:35:18,790 --> 02:35:23,090
He was taken by both shadow and flame.

1432
02:35:24,990 --> 02:35:28,490
A Balrog of Morgoth.

1433
02:35:29,390 --> 02:35:32,690
For we went needlessly into the net of Moria.

1434
02:35:34,890 --> 02:35:37,990
Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.

1435
02:35:38,790 --> 02:35:41,990
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1436
02:35:46,790 --> 02:35:50,890
Do not let the great emptiness
of Khazad-d�m fill your heart...

1437
02:35:51,290 --> 02:35:53,490
...Gimli, son of Gloin.

1438
02:35:54,590 --> 02:35:57,990
For the world has grown full of peril...

1439
02:35:59,590 --> 02:36:02,190
...and in all lands...

1440
02:36:02,490 --> 02:36:05,890
...love is now mingled with grief.

1441
02:36:18,590 --> 02:36:21,290
What now becomes of this fellowship?

1442
02:36:21,990 --> 02:36:24,790
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1443
02:36:27,890 --> 02:36:31,090
The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.

1444
02:36:31,090 --> 02:36:34,190
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1445
02:36:35,190 --> 02:36:37,890
...to the ruin of all.

1446
02:36:42,390 --> 02:36:47,890
Yet hope remains while the company is true.

1447
02:36:49,690 --> 02:36:54,190
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1448
02:36:54,790 --> 02:36:58,390
...for you are weary with sorrow and much toil.

1449
02:37:00,790 --> 02:37:02,790
Tonight, you will sleep....

1450
02:37:03,190 --> 02:37:06,490
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...

1451
02:37:08,090 --> 02:37:09,790
...one who has seen the eye!

1452
02:37:24,490 --> 02:37:26,990
A lament for Gandalf.

1453
02:37:34,390 --> 02:37:35,790
What do they say about him?

1454
02:37:36,290 --> 02:37:38,690
I have not the heart to tell you.

1455
02:37:41,690 --> 02:37:43,890
For me, the grief is still too near.

1456
02:37:46,890 --> 02:37:49,690
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1457
02:37:50,090 --> 02:37:52,890
There should be a verse about them.

1458
02:37:56,390 --> 02:37:58,290
The finest rockets ever seen

1459
02:37:59,490 --> 02:38:02,290
They burst in stars of blue and green

1460
02:38:03,390 --> 02:38:08,390
Or after thunder, silver showers

1461
02:38:09,190 --> 02:38:11,890
Came falling like a rain of flowers

1462
02:38:12,290 --> 02:38:15,990
Oh, that doesn't do them justice by a long road.

1463
02:38:26,890 --> 02:38:29,490
Take some rest.

1464
02:38:29,790 --> 02:38:32,390
These borders are well-protected.

1465
02:38:32,690 --> 02:38:35,090
I will find no rest here.

1466
02:38:38,090 --> 02:38:40,890
I heard her voice inside my head.

1467
02:38:41,390 --> 02:38:44,890
She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor.

1468
02:38:45,190 --> 02:38:50,390
She said to me; "Even now there is hope Left."

1469
02:38:52,090 --> 02:38:54,690
But I cannot see it.

1470
02:38:56,190 --> 02:38:58,590
It is long since we had any hope.

1471
02:39:08,890 --> 02:39:10,990
My father is a noble man.

1472
02:39:11,790 --> 02:39:13,990
But his rule is failing...

1473
02:39:17,190 --> 02:39:19,590
...and our people lose faith.

1474
02:39:21,190 --> 02:39:24,590
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1475
02:39:24,890 --> 02:39:28,290
I would see the glory of Gondor restored.

1476
02:39:31,290 --> 02:39:34,190
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1477
02:39:34,890 --> 02:39:36,790
The white tower of Ecthelion.

1478
02:39:37,190 --> 02:39:40,790
Glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver.

1479
02:39:41,590 --> 02:39:44,990
Its banners caught high in the morning breeze.

1480
02:39:48,090 --> 02:39:49,990
Have you ever been called home...

1481
02:39:49,990 --> 02:39:53,990
...by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?

1482
02:39:54,790 --> 02:39:57,790
I have seen the white city...

1483
02:39:58,290 --> 02:39:59,690
...long ago.

1484
02:40:00,790 --> 02:40:05,590
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1485
02:40:06,690 --> 02:40:09,490
And the tower guard shall take up the call:

1486
02:40:10,190 --> 02:40:13,290
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1487
02:41:20,690 --> 02:41:23,090
Will you look into the mirror?

1488
02:41:23,390 --> 02:41:24,790
What will I see?

1489
02:41:27,890 --> 02:41:30,190
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1490
02:41:31,090 --> 02:41:32,890
For the mirror...

1491
02:41:33,190 --> 02:41:35,590
...shows many things.

1492
02:41:38,690 --> 02:41:40,890
Things that were...

1493
02:41:41,290 --> 02:41:43,790
...things that are...

1494
02:41:44,590 --> 02:41:46,390
...and some things...

1495
02:41:50,190 --> 02:41:53,390
...that have not yet come to pass.

1496
02:43:15,990 --> 02:43:18,790
I know what it is you saw.

1497
02:43:21,290 --> 02:43:23,590
For it is also in my mind.

1498
02:43:25,590 --> 02:43:29,390
It is what will come to pass if you should fail.

1499
02:43:31,990 --> 02:43:36,590
The fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.

1500
02:43:37,490 --> 02:43:40,690
He will try to take the ring.

1501
02:43:40,990 --> 02:43:42,890
You know of whom I speak.

1502
02:43:43,990 --> 02:43:48,390
One by one, it will destroy them all.

1503
02:43:50,190 --> 02:43:52,490
If you ask it of me...

1504
02:43:52,990 --> 02:43:55,890
... I will give you the one ring.

1505
02:43:57,190 --> 02:43:59,290
You offer it to me freely.

1506
02:44:03,790 --> 02:44:07,590
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1507
02:44:14,290 --> 02:44:17,390
In place of a dark lord, you would have a queen...

1508
02:44:17,890 --> 02:44:21,490
...not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn!

1509
02:44:22,390 --> 02:44:25,290
Treacherous as the sea!

1510
02:44:25,790 --> 02:44:30,590
Stronger than the foundations of the earth!

1511
02:44:31,290 --> 02:44:33,590
All shall love me...

1512
02:44:33,890 --> 02:44:36,590
...and despair.

1513
02:44:50,790 --> 02:44:54,990
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1514
02:44:55,390 --> 02:44:57,690
...and go into the West...

1515
02:44:58,090 --> 02:45:02,390
...and remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.

1516
02:45:06,090 --> 02:45:10,090
You are a ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a ring of power...

1517
02:45:11,190 --> 02:45:12,590
...is to be alone.

1518
02:45:16,090 --> 02:45:18,790
This is Nenya, the ring of Adamant.

1519
02:45:19,090 --> 02:45:20,590
And I am its keeper.

1520
02:45:23,890 --> 02:45:27,390
This task was appointed to you.

1521
02:45:28,590 --> 02:45:31,290
And if you do not find a way...

1522
02:45:32,690 --> 02:45:34,590
...no one will.

1523
02:45:35,090 --> 02:45:38,090
Then I know what I must do.

1524
02:45:38,790 --> 02:45:39,990
It's just...

1525
02:45:43,290 --> 02:45:45,490
...I'm afraid to do it.

1526
02:45:48,990 --> 02:45:53,990
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1527
02:45:59,590 --> 02:46:05,090
Do you know how the orcs first came into being?

1528
02:46:06,090 --> 02:46:09,190
They were elves once.

1529
02:46:10,490 --> 02:46:13,690
Taken by the dark powers...

1530
02:46:14,190 --> 02:46:17,190
...tortured and mutilated.

1531
02:46:17,590 --> 02:46:22,690
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1532
02:46:23,090 --> 02:46:24,890
And now...

1533
02:46:26,490 --> 02:46:28,290
...perfected.

1534
02:46:29,090 --> 02:46:32,090
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1535
02:46:34,190 --> 02:46:36,390
...whom do you serve?

1536
02:46:36,690 --> 02:46:39,090
Saruman!

1537
02:46:59,990 --> 02:47:03,290
Hunt them down. Do not stop until, they are found.

1538
02:47:03,690 --> 02:47:06,490
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1539
02:47:06,790 --> 02:47:09,590
You will taste man-flesh!

1540
02:47:14,790 --> 02:47:18,290
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1541
02:47:18,690 --> 02:47:22,690
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1542
02:47:24,790 --> 02:47:25,990
Kill the others.

1543
02:47:45,190 --> 02:47:50,390
Never before have we clad strangers
in the garb of our own people.

1544
02:47:51,690 --> 02:47:55,390
May these cloaks help shield
you from unfriendly eyes.

1545
02:48:02,690 --> 02:48:04,290
Lembas.

1546
02:48:04,590 --> 02:48:06,190
Elvish waybread.

1547
02:48:08,590 --> 02:48:11,490
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1548
02:48:18,090 --> 02:48:19,990
How many did you eat?

1549
02:48:19,990 --> 02:48:21,790
Four.

1550
02:48:27,690 --> 02:48:30,190
Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

1551
02:48:30,490 --> 02:48:34,390
Mordor orcs now hold the
eastern shore of the Anduin.

1552
02:48:34,790 --> 02:48:37,190
Nor will you find safety on the western bank.

1553
02:48:37,490 --> 02:48:41,190
Strange creatures bearing the mark of the
white hand have been seen on our borders.

1554
02:48:41,590 --> 02:48:46,390
Seldom do orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1555
02:48:54,990 --> 02:48:57,190
Le aphadar aen.
(You are being tracked.)

1556
02:48:59,290 --> 02:49:03,690
By river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the falls of Rauros.

1557
02:49:21,190 --> 02:49:25,790
My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim.

1558
02:49:26,190 --> 02:49:29,490
Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.

1559
02:49:35,090 --> 02:49:37,490
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

1560
02:49:37,790 --> 02:49:41,590
They have already seen service in war.

1561
02:49:41,890 --> 02:49:44,090
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

1562
02:49:44,390 --> 02:49:47,490
You will find your courage.

1563
02:49:49,490 --> 02:49:51,490
And for you, Samwise Gamgee...

1564
02:49:51,490 --> 02:49:54,390
...Elven rope made of hithlain.

1565
02:49:54,390 --> 02:49:56,590
Thank you, my lady.

1566
02:49:58,490 --> 02:50:01,690
Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?

1567
02:50:08,190 --> 02:50:11,090
And what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves?

1568
02:50:11,490 --> 02:50:13,590
Nothing.

1569
02:50:14,290 --> 02:50:17,490
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

1570
02:50:18,190 --> 02:50:23,190
...for she is more fair than all
the jewels beneath the earth.

1571
02:50:30,390 --> 02:50:31,890
Actually....

1572
02:50:32,190 --> 02:50:33,790
There was one thing.

1573
02:50:34,690 --> 02:50:37,190
No, no, I couIdn't.
It's quite impossible.

1574
02:50:37,490 --> 02:50:40,190
Stupid to ask.

1575
02:50:42,890 --> 02:50:44,890
I have nothing greater to give...

1576
02:50:44,890 --> 02:50:48,590
...than the gift you already bear.

1577
02:50:49,590 --> 02:50:51,390
Am meleth d�n...
(For her love...)

1578
02:50:52,090 --> 02:50:56,990
...I ant e guil Arwen Und�miel p�gatha.
(...I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar will diminish.)

1579
02:50:58,290 --> 02:51:02,790
An�ron i e broniatha, ad ae periatham...
(I would have her leave these shores...)

1580
02:51:03,190 --> 02:51:06,390
...athar i methid en-amar hen.
(...and be with her people.)

1581
02:51:08,090 --> 02:51:13,690
An�ron i e c�ratha na Valannor.
(I would have her take the ship to Valinor.)

1582
02:51:14,090 --> 02:51:16,990
That choice is yet before her.

1583
02:51:17,890 --> 02:51:20,690
You have your own choice to make, Aragorn.

1584
02:51:21,090 --> 02:51:26,590
To rise above the height of all your
fathers since the days of Elendil...

1585
02:51:27,090 --> 02:51:31,290
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

1586
02:51:38,790 --> 02:51:40,690
Nam�ri�.
(Farewell.)

1587
02:51:44,190 --> 02:51:47,990
Nadath n� i moe cerich.
(There is much you have yet to do.)

1588
02:51:49,690 --> 02:51:58,190
Dan, �-'eveditham, Elessar.
(We shall not meet again, Elessar.)

1589
02:51:59,090 --> 02:52:02,190
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

1590
02:52:02,190 --> 02:52:05,690
I give you the light of Earendil...

1591
02:52:06,690 --> 02:52:08,890
...our most beloved star.

1592
02:52:18,090 --> 02:52:22,290
May it be a light for you in dark places...

1593
02:52:22,690 --> 02:52:26,690
... when all other lights go out.

1594
02:52:35,790 --> 02:52:38,790
I have taken my worst wound at this parting...

1595
02:52:39,590 --> 02:52:43,590
...having looked my last upon that which is fairest.

1596
02:52:44,590 --> 02:52:47,790
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

1597
02:52:48,190 --> 02:52:50,090
What was her gift?

1598
02:52:50,390 --> 02:52:55,090
I asked her for one hair from her golden head.

1599
02:52:55,990 --> 02:52:58,790
She gave me three.

1600
02:54:41,090 --> 02:54:44,390
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1601
02:54:48,290 --> 02:54:51,190
I had hoped we would lose him on the river.

1602
02:54:51,590 --> 02:54:54,590
But he's too clever a waterman.

1603
02:54:55,590 --> 02:54:58,790
And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts...

1604
02:54:58,790 --> 02:55:01,090
...it will make the crossing even more dangerous.

1605
02:55:01,390 --> 02:55:03,390
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1606
02:55:03,690 --> 02:55:06,690
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

1607
02:55:07,090 --> 02:55:09,990
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1608
02:55:10,990 --> 02:55:13,890
- Mr. Frodo
- I'm all right.

1609
02:55:14,190 --> 02:55:15,290
But you're not.

1610
02:55:15,690 --> 02:55:18,190
I'm here to help you.

1611
02:55:18,190 --> 02:55:19,990
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1612
02:55:26,090 --> 02:55:28,590
You can't help me, Sam.

1613
02:55:30,990 --> 02:55:32,590
Not this time.

1614
02:55:35,590 --> 02:55:37,590
Get some sleep.

1615
02:55:43,990 --> 02:55:46,090
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1616
02:55:46,690 --> 02:55:49,290
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1617
02:55:50,090 --> 02:55:52,190
Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.

1618
02:55:52,590 --> 02:55:55,290
There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.

1619
02:55:55,990 --> 02:55:57,890
You were quick enough to trust the elves.

1620
02:55:59,790 --> 02:56:02,590
Have you so little faith in your own people?

1621
02:56:02,590 --> 02:56:05,590
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1622
02:56:05,990 --> 02:56:09,190
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in men.

1623
02:56:09,490 --> 02:56:11,590
But you will not see that.

1624
02:56:12,090 --> 02:56:13,390
You are afraid!

1625
02:56:13,790 --> 02:56:16,190
All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.

1626
02:56:16,590 --> 02:56:19,890
Scared of who you are, of what you are.

1627
02:56:22,490 --> 02:56:26,690
I will not lead the ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1628
02:56:38,690 --> 02:56:39,990
Frodo.

1629
02:56:41,890 --> 02:56:43,290
The Argonath.

1630
02:56:46,890 --> 02:56:50,390
Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old.

1631
02:56:51,290 --> 02:56:53,090
My kin.

1632
02:58:12,290 --> 02:58:14,290
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1633
02:58:14,690 --> 02:58:17,090
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1634
02:58:17,390 --> 02:58:20,690
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

1635
02:58:21,290 --> 02:58:24,990
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

1636
02:58:25,290 --> 02:58:28,390
...an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks.

1637
02:58:28,690 --> 02:58:31,690
And after that, it gets even better.

1638
02:58:32,190 --> 02:58:36,890
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1639
02:58:37,390 --> 02:58:38,690
That is our road.

1640
02:58:40,290 --> 02:58:43,390
I suggest you take some rest and
recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1641
02:58:43,690 --> 02:58:45,290
Recover my...

1642
02:58:48,490 --> 02:58:50,290
- We should Leave now.
- No.

1643
02:58:50,590 --> 02:58:54,790
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1644
02:58:55,190 --> 02:58:58,590
It is not the eastern shore that worries me.

1645
02:58:58,890 --> 02:59:02,690
A shadow and a threat has
been growing in my mind.

1646
02:59:03,390 --> 02:59:07,390
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1647
02:59:09,590 --> 02:59:14,290
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young hobbit.

1648
02:59:15,090 --> 02:59:16,690
Where's Frodo?

1649
02:59:42,390 --> 02:59:44,290
None of us should wander alone.

1650
02:59:45,590 --> 02:59:47,690
You, least of all.

1651
02:59:47,990 --> 02:59:50,290
So much depends on you.

1652
02:59:51,490 --> 02:59:53,390
Frodo?

1653
03:00:00,590 --> 03:00:03,090
I know why you seek solitude.

1654
03:00:03,890 --> 03:00:07,190
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1655
03:00:08,090 --> 03:00:11,090
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1656
03:00:12,790 --> 03:00:15,390
There are other ways, Frodo.

1657
03:00:15,690 --> 03:00:19,390
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

1658
03:00:19,690 --> 03:00:23,290
It would seem like wisdom but
for the warning in my heart.

1659
03:00:23,690 --> 03:00:26,690
Warning...against what?

1660
03:00:26,990 --> 03:00:28,990
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1661
03:00:29,290 --> 03:00:32,790
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1662
03:00:33,190 --> 03:00:36,790
...don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

1663
03:00:38,790 --> 03:00:41,890
I ask only for the strength to defend my people!

1664
03:00:43,690 --> 03:00:45,590
- If you would but lend me the ring.
- No.

1665
03:00:46,890 --> 03:00:50,390
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

1666
03:00:52,490 --> 03:00:55,590
What chance do you think you have?

1667
03:00:55,890 --> 03:01:00,390
They will find you.
They will take the ring.

1668
03:01:00,790 --> 03:01:04,390
And you will beg for death before the end!

1669
03:01:06,690 --> 03:01:08,690
You fool!

1670
03:01:08,690 --> 03:01:12,790
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1671
03:01:13,090 --> 03:01:15,790
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1672
03:01:16,090 --> 03:01:17,290
- Give it to me!
- No!

1673
03:01:17,590 --> 03:01:19,390
- Give it to me!
- No.

1674
03:01:27,090 --> 03:01:28,990
I see your mind.

1675
03:01:29,390 --> 03:01:32,190
You will take the ring to Sauron!

1676
03:01:32,490 --> 03:01:34,290
You will betray us!

1677
03:01:34,590 --> 03:01:37,690
You'll go to your death, and the death of us all!

1678
03:01:38,190 --> 03:01:41,690
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1679
03:01:48,890 --> 03:01:50,390
Frodo?

1680
03:01:54,690 --> 03:01:56,290
Frodo.

1681
03:02:00,290 --> 03:02:02,190
What have I done?

1682
03:02:02,490 --> 03:02:04,190
Please, Frodo.

1683
03:02:04,490 --> 03:02:06,990
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1684
03:02:37,390 --> 03:02:40,890
Ash Ghur�m
(They will fall)

1685
03:02:55,690 --> 03:02:56,990
Frodo?

1686
03:02:58,290 --> 03:03:01,290
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the ring?

1687
03:03:01,690 --> 03:03:03,390
Stay away!

1688
03:03:03,790 --> 03:03:05,390
Frodo!

1689
03:03:07,690 --> 03:03:11,390
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?

1690
03:03:21,290 --> 03:03:23,590
Would you destroy it?

1691
03:03:28,790 --> 03:03:30,590
Aragorn.

1692
03:03:34,090 --> 03:03:36,290
Aragorn.

1693
03:03:38,290 --> 03:03:39,990
Elessar.

1694
03:03:47,690 --> 03:03:50,890
I would have gone with you to the end.

1695
03:03:51,690 --> 03:03:54,490
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1696
03:03:57,990 --> 03:03:59,090
I know.

1697
03:04:01,490 --> 03:04:06,790
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1698
03:04:10,790 --> 03:04:12,390
Go, Frodo!

1699
03:04:15,490 --> 03:04:16,990
Run.

1700
03:04:16,990 --> 03:04:18,790
Run!

1701
03:04:43,390 --> 03:04:44,990
Mr. Frodo!

1702
03:04:54,490 --> 03:04:56,090
Find the halfling!

1703
03:04:57,790 --> 03:05:00,190
Find the halfling!

1704
03:05:03,890 --> 03:05:05,490
Elendil!

1705
03:05:11,990 --> 03:05:13,490
Aragorn, go!

1706
03:05:35,190 --> 03:05:36,490
Frodo!

1707
03:05:37,090 --> 03:05:38,690
Hide here. Quick!

1708
03:05:39,390 --> 03:05:40,790
Come on!

1709
03:05:43,290 --> 03:05:45,290
What's he doing?

1710
03:05:49,490 --> 03:05:51,490
He's leaving.

1711
03:05:56,390 --> 03:05:59,190
- No!
- Pippin!

1712
03:06:04,190 --> 03:06:06,390
Run, Frodo. Go!

1713
03:06:07,090 --> 03:06:09,990
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

1714
03:06:10,590 --> 03:06:12,090
- Over here!
- This way!

1715
03:06:23,090 --> 03:06:25,290
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

1716
03:07:20,690 --> 03:07:23,590
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.

1717
03:08:06,890 --> 03:08:07,890
Run!

1718
03:11:39,590 --> 03:11:41,090
No.

1719
03:11:45,190 --> 03:11:48,090
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

1720
03:11:48,390 --> 03:11:50,390
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1721
03:11:52,390 --> 03:11:53,790
I let Frodo go.

1722
03:11:54,490 --> 03:11:56,990
Then you did what I could not.

1723
03:11:58,090 --> 03:12:01,290
I tried to take the ring from him.

1724
03:12:01,890 --> 03:12:05,990
- The ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

1725
03:12:06,390 --> 03:12:08,590
I did not see it.

1726
03:12:08,890 --> 03:12:11,990
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

1727
03:12:12,590 --> 03:12:14,990
You fought bravely.

1728
03:12:15,390 --> 03:12:17,890
You have kept your honor.

1729
03:12:18,690 --> 03:12:20,390
Leave it.

1730
03:12:20,890 --> 03:12:22,890
It is over.

1731
03:12:24,190 --> 03:12:29,290
The world of men will fall and
all will come to darkness...

1732
03:12:29,890 --> 03:12:32,690
...and my city to ruin.

1733
03:12:36,890 --> 03:12:39,590
I do not know what strength is in my blood...

1734
03:12:39,590 --> 03:12:43,690
...but I swear to you, I will
not let the white city fall...

1735
03:12:44,790 --> 03:12:47,190
...nor our people fail.

1736
03:12:48,190 --> 03:12:49,590
Our people.

1737
03:12:53,490 --> 03:12:55,490
Our people.

1738
03:13:17,290 --> 03:13:20,190
I would have followed you, my brother.

1739
03:13:21,890 --> 03:13:23,790
My captain.

1740
03:13:26,590 --> 03:13:28,390
My king.

1741
03:13:48,090 --> 03:13:50,190
Be at peace...

1742
03:13:50,790 --> 03:13:52,590
...son of Gondor.

1743
03:14:09,090 --> 03:14:12,290
They will look for his coming from the white tower.

1744
03:14:12,990 --> 03:14:15,890
But he will not return.

1745
03:14:39,290 --> 03:14:41,190
Frodo!

1746
03:15:00,690 --> 03:15:03,890
I wish the ring had never come to me.

1747
03:15:05,190 --> 03:15:07,990
I wish none of this had happened.

1748
03:15:11,190 --> 03:15:13,890
So do all who live to see such times...

1749
03:15:14,190 --> 03:15:17,490
...but that is not for them to decide.

1750
03:15:17,890 --> 03:15:20,390
All you have to decide...

1751
03:15:20,690 --> 03:15:25,290
...is what to do with the time that is given to you.

1752
03:15:54,190 --> 03:15:56,190
Frodo, no!

1753
03:15:56,990 --> 03:15:58,190
Frodo!

1754
03:15:58,890 --> 03:16:01,490
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

1755
03:16:05,190 --> 03:16:07,090
Go back, Sam!

1756
03:16:07,690 --> 03:16:11,090
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

1757
03:16:11,390 --> 03:16:14,090
And I'm coming with you!

1758
03:16:14,790 --> 03:16:17,090
You can't swim!

1759
03:16:20,890 --> 03:16:22,590
Sam!

1760
03:16:28,190 --> 03:16:29,590
Sam!

1761
03:17:10,490 --> 03:17:13,190
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1762
03:17:13,590 --> 03:17:17,690
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1763
03:17:18,990 --> 03:17:21,490
And I don't mean to.

1764
03:17:21,890 --> 03:17:23,990
I don't mean to.

1765
03:17:25,790 --> 03:17:27,490
Oh Sam.

1766
03:17:42,490 --> 03:17:44,090
Come on.

1767
03:18:12,490 --> 03:18:16,890
Hurry! Frodo and Sam have
reached the eastern shore.

1768
03:18:31,990 --> 03:18:36,890
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1769
03:18:40,390 --> 03:18:45,090
Then it has all been in vain.
The fellowship has failed.

1770
03:18:57,090 --> 03:19:00,190
Not if we hold true to each other.

1771
03:19:01,690 --> 03:19:05,990
We will not abandon Merry and
Pippin to torment and death.

1772
03:19:07,090 --> 03:19:12,190
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1773
03:19:13,690 --> 03:19:15,590
We travel light.

1774
03:19:15,890 --> 03:19:17,790
Let us hunt some orc.

1775
03:19:20,790 --> 03:19:22,790
Yes!

1776
03:19:41,790 --> 03:19:43,190
Mordor.

1777
03:19:43,890 --> 03:19:47,090
I hope the others find a safer road.

1778
03:19:48,190 --> 03:19:50,690
Strider will look after them.

1779
03:19:51,790 --> 03:19:54,990
I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.

1780
03:19:55,490 --> 03:19:57,790
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1781
03:19:57,790 --> 03:19:59,490
We may.

1782
03:20:01,690 --> 03:20:02,790
Sam...

1783
03:20:06,390 --> 03:20:08,890
...I'm glad you are with me.

1
00:00:40,190 --> 00:01:00,000
Orginally by Bokutox. Fixings by Muhib@Subscene

2
00:01:19,293 --> 00:01:21,535
I've got one!

3
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:24,164
I've got a fish, Smeag. Smeagol!

4
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,459
Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on. Pull it in.

5
00:01:35,684 --> 00:01:37,511
Deagol!

6
00:02:34,908 --> 00:02:36,735
Deagol?

7
00:02:39,288 --> 00:02:41,529
Deagol.

8
00:02:57,347 --> 00:02:59,423
Give us that, Deagol, my love.

9
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:05,676
Why?

10
00:03:06,772 --> 00:03:09,014
Because...

11
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:12,940
it's my birthday and I wants it.

12
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:52,238
My precious.

13
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,716
They cursed us.

14
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,260
Murderer.

15
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,884
"Murderer" they called us.

16
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:11,847
They cursed us and drove us away.

17
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:14,686
Gollum.

18
00:05:14,854 --> 00:05:16,563
Gollum.

19
00:05:16,732 --> 00:05:18,688
Gollum.

20
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:25,238
And we wept, precious.

21
00:05:25,406 --> 00:05:28,989
We wept to be so alone.

22
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:35,363
- and cool
- So nice for feet

23
00:05:36,376 --> 00:05:40,753
And we only wish To catch a fish

24
00:05:40,922 --> 00:05:44,172
So juicy sweet

25
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:54,058
And we forgot the taste of bread...

26
00:05:54,226 --> 00:05:57,844
the sound of trees...

27
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,934
the softness of the wind.

28
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:08,238
We even forgot our own name.

29
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:22,790
My precious.

30
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:09,288
Wake up!

31
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:12,002
Wake up!

32
00:07:12,177 --> 00:07:13,969
Wake up, sleepies.

33
00:07:14,137 --> 00:07:16,010
We must go, yes.

34
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:18,850
We must go at once.

35
00:07:22,395 --> 00:07:25,479
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

36
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:30,230
I've gone and had too much.

37
00:07:31,612 --> 00:07:33,355
Must be getting late.

38
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,025
No.

39
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,108
It isn't.

40
00:07:37,284 --> 00:07:40,320
It isn't midday yet.

41
00:07:40,496 --> 00:07:43,069
The days are growing darker.

42
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:49,543
Come on!

43
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:54,207
Must go! No time!

44
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:56,756
Not before Mr. Frodo's had something to eat.

45
00:07:56,928 --> 00:07:59,799
No time to lose, silly.

46
00:08:08,565 --> 00:08:09,845
Here.

47
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,896
What about you?

48
00:08:15,071 --> 00:08:18,440
Oh, no, I'm not hungry.
Leastways, not for lembas bread.

49
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:20,408
Sam.

50
00:08:22,996 --> 00:08:24,538
All right.

51
00:08:24,705 --> 00:08:27,196
We don't have that much left.

52
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,245
We have to be careful or we're going to run out.

53
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:35,339
You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.

54
00:08:35,507 --> 00:08:36,918
I've rationed it.

55
00:08:37,426 --> 00:08:39,086
There should be enough.

56
00:08:41,263 --> 00:08:42,461
For what?

57
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:45,884
The journey home.

58
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:56,058
Come, Hobbitses.

59
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:59,319
Very close now.

60
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:02,739
Very close to Mordor.

61
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,578
No safe places here.

62
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,903
Hurry.

63
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:02,006
It's good.

64
00:10:02,926 --> 00:10:04,669
Definitely from the Shire.

65
00:10:06,888 --> 00:10:09,011
Longbottom Leaf.

66
00:10:14,354 --> 00:10:18,683
I feel like I'm back at The Green Dragon.

67
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:23,025
- Green Dragon.
- A mug of ale in my hand.

68
00:10:23,195 --> 00:10:27,774
Putting my feet up on a settle after a hard day's work.

69
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:31,818
Only, you've never done a hard day's work.

70
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:47,669
Welcome, my lords...

71
00:10:47,844 --> 00:10:50,086
to Isengard!

72
00:10:50,472 --> 00:10:54,220
You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led us on...

73
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:59,386
and now we find you feasting and... and smoking!

74
00:10:59,564 --> 00:11:02,731
We are sitting on a field of victory...

75
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,400
enjoying a few well-earned comforts.

76
00:11:07,488 --> 00:11:11,320
The salted pork is particularly good.

77
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:14,240
Salted pork?

78
00:11:15,454 --> 00:11:18,870
- Hobbits.
- We're under orders from Treebeard...

79
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:21,876
who's taken over management of Isengard.

80
00:11:24,421 --> 00:11:27,422
Young Master Gandalf.

81
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:32,170
I'm glad you've come.

82
00:11:32,346 --> 00:11:36,758
Wood and water, stock and stone I can master.

83
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:40,599
But there is a wizard to manage here...

84
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,763
locked in his tower.

85
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:46,770
Show yourself.

86
00:11:47,026 --> 00:11:48,734
Be careful.

87
00:11:49,528 --> 00:11:52,198
Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.

88
00:11:52,365 --> 00:11:54,488
Well, let's just have his head and be done with it.

89
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:56,698
No.

90
00:11:57,036 --> 00:11:59,361
We need him alive.

91
00:12:00,373 --> 00:12:02,946
We need him to talk.

92
00:12:04,836 --> 00:12:09,046
You have fought many wars and
slain many men, Theoden King...

93
00:12:09,214 --> 00:12:10,708
and made peace afterwards.

94
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:15,841
Can we not take counsel together
as we once did, my old friend?

95
00:12:16,012 --> 00:12:19,216
Can we not have peace, you and I?

96
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:21,300
We shall have peace.

97
00:12:23,228 --> 00:12:25,351
We shall have peace...

98
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:29,566
when you answer for the burning of the Westfold...

99
00:12:29,735 --> 00:12:32,486
and the children that lie dead there!

100
00:12:33,238 --> 00:12:37,402
We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers...

101
00:12:37,575 --> 00:12:39,652
whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead...

102
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:43,363
against the gates of the Hornburg, are avenged!

103
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:50,503
When you hang from a gibbet for
the sport of your own crows...

104
00:12:51,422 --> 00:12:53,664
we shall have peace.

105
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:59,131
Gibbets and crows?

106
00:12:59,472 --> 00:13:00,716
Dotard!

107
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:05,017
What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?

108
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,511
Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.

109
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:11,606
Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dur itself...

110
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:15,772
along with the crowns of the seven
kings and the rods of the Five Wizards!

111
00:13:15,946 --> 00:13:18,899
Your treachery has already cost many lives.

112
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:21,446
Thousands more are now at risk.

113
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:23,990
But you could save them, Saruman.

114
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:26,450
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

115
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:29,908
So you have come here for information.

116
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:32,621
I have some for you.

117
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:41,046
Something festers in the heart of Middle-earth.

118
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,462
Something that you have failed to see.

119
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:49,474
But the Great Eye has seen it.

120
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:54,221
Even now he presses his advantage.

121
00:13:55,984 --> 00:13:59,318
His attack will come soon.

122
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:03,655
You're all going to die.

123
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:09,411
But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?

124
00:14:09,581 --> 00:14:14,207
You cannot think that this Ranger will
ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.

125
00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:20,463
This exile, crept from the
shadows, will never be crowned king.

126
00:14:21,802 --> 00:14:25,466
Gandalf does not hesitate to
sacrifice those closest to him...

127
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:28,595
those he professes to love.

128
00:14:29,642 --> 00:14:34,185
Tell me, what words of comfort
did you give the Halfling...

129
00:14:34,355 --> 00:14:37,391
before you sent him to his doom?

130
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:44,528
The path that you have set
him on can only lead to death.

131
00:14:44,865 --> 00:14:47,024
I've heard enough!

132
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:49,027
Shoot him. Stick an arrow in his gob.

133
00:14:49,536 --> 00:14:51,196
No.

134
00:14:51,664 --> 00:14:53,870
Come down, Saruman...

135
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:57,990
- and your life will be spared.
- Save your pity and your mercy.

136
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,498
I have no use for it!

137
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:10,180
Saruman...

138
00:15:11,224 --> 00:15:14,391
your staff is broken.

139
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,731
Grima, you need not follow him.

140
00:15:29,908 --> 00:15:32,578
You were not always as you are now.

141
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:35,580
You were once a Man of Rohan.

142
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:36,993
Come down.

143
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,871
A Man of Rohan?

144
00:15:40,795 --> 00:15:43,036
What is the house of Rohan...

145
00:15:43,213 --> 00:15:46,879
but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek...

146
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,751
and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs?

147
00:15:51,263 --> 00:15:57,716
The victory at Helm's Deep does not
belong to you, Theoden Horse-master.

148
00:15:58,353 --> 00:16:02,931
You are a lesser son of greater sires.

149
00:16:05,276 --> 00:16:06,984
Grima...

150
00:16:07,821 --> 00:16:09,694
come down.

151
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:11,442
Be free of him.

152
00:16:11,617 --> 00:16:15,614
- Free? He will never be free.
- No.

153
00:16:15,995 --> 00:16:18,617
Get down, cur!

154
00:16:20,374 --> 00:16:21,655
Saruman!

155
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:24,455
You were deep in the enemy's counsel.

156
00:16:24,962 --> 00:16:27,121
Tell us what you know!

157
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:33,875
You withdraw your guard, and I will
tell you where your doom will be decided.

158
00:16:34,054 --> 00:16:37,589
I will not be held prisoner here.

159
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:06,252
Send word to all our allies...

160
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:09,337
and to every corner of
Middle-earth that still stands free.

161
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,001
The enemy moves against us. We
need to know where he will strike.

162
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:36,144
The filth of Saruman...

163
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:40,154
is washing away.

164
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:44,870
Trees will come back to live here.

165
00:17:45,373 --> 00:17:47,532
Young trees.

166
00:17:47,709 --> 00:17:49,915
- Wild trees.
- Pippin!

167
00:17:59,387 --> 00:18:01,546
Bless my bark!

168
00:18:01,723 --> 00:18:03,596
Peregrin Took!

169
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:06,388
I'll take that, my lad.

170
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,435
Quickly, now.

171
00:18:58,611 --> 00:19:04,197
Tonight we remember those who gave
their blood to defend this country.

172
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:06,907
Hail the victorious dead.

173
00:19:07,077 --> 00:19:08,488
Hail!

174
00:19:19,465 --> 00:19:21,374
No pauses.

175
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:25,714
- No spills.
- And no regurgitation.

176
00:19:26,221 --> 00:19:27,881
So it's a drinking game?

177
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:32,137
Last one standing wins.

178
00:19:36,481 --> 00:19:38,474
What'll we drink to? Let's drink to victory!

179
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,061
To victory!

180
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,530
Be thou, Aragorn, well.

181
00:20:24,027 --> 00:20:25,687
I am happy for you.

182
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,479
He is an honorable man.

183
00:20:28,907 --> 00:20:31,362
You are both honorable men.

184
00:20:33,203 --> 00:20:38,541
It was not Theoden of Rohan
who led our people to victory.

185
00:20:46,716 --> 00:20:48,542
Don't listen to me.

186
00:20:49,385 --> 00:20:50,879
You are young.

187
00:20:51,053 --> 00:20:53,379
And tonight is for you.

188
00:21:07,736 --> 00:21:09,396
Here, here.

189
00:21:10,906 --> 00:21:16,825
It's the Dwarves that go
swimming with little, hairy women.

190
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:23,453
I feel something.

191
00:21:25,587 --> 00:21:28,077
A slight tingle in my fingers.

192
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:30,375
I think it's affecting me.

193
00:21:32,302 --> 00:21:34,009
What did I say?

194
00:21:34,178 --> 00:21:37,512
He can't hold his liquor.

195
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:46,184
Game over.

196
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:49,773
Oh, you can search far and wide
You can drink the whole town dry

197
00:21:49,943 --> 00:21:53,893
But you'll never find a beer so brown
But you'll never find a beer so brown

198
00:21:54,073 --> 00:21:58,449
As the one we drink in our hometown
As the one we drink in our hometown

199
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:02,533
You can drink your fancy ales
You can drink them by the flagon

200
00:22:02,706 --> 00:22:05,872
But the only brew for the brave and true

201
00:22:08,504 --> 00:22:09,783
Pippin!

202
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:13,291
But the only brew for the brave and true

203
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:16,338
Comes from The Green Dragon

204
00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:21,890
Thank you! I win!

205
00:22:23,643 --> 00:22:26,134
No news of Frodo?

206
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:29,812
No word. Nothing.

207
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,808
We have time.

208
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,605
Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.

209
00:22:38,365 --> 00:22:40,442
Do we know that?

210
00:22:44,288 --> 00:22:45,996
What does your heart tell you?

211
00:22:53,047 --> 00:22:56,380
That Frodo is alive.

212
00:22:58,552 --> 00:23:00,343
Yes.

213
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:05,089
Yes, he's alive.

214
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:10,187
Too risky. Too risky.

215
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:11,600
Thieves.

216
00:23:11,773 --> 00:23:13,812
They stole it from us.

217
00:23:13,983 --> 00:23:17,483
Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.

218
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:22,365
Quiet! Mustn't wake them.

219
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:25,071
Mustn't ruin it now.

220
00:23:25,244 --> 00:23:27,321
But they knows.

221
00:23:27,497 --> 00:23:29,370
They knows.

222
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:32,161
They suspects us.

223
00:23:33,377 --> 00:23:36,911
What's it saying, my precious, my love?

224
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:40,671
Is Smeagol losing his nerve?

225
00:23:41,343 --> 00:23:43,715
No. Not.

226
00:23:43,888 --> 00:23:48,134
Never. Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses.

227
00:23:48,308 --> 00:23:53,136
Smeagol wants to see them dead.

228
00:23:53,313 --> 00:23:55,851
And we will.

229
00:23:56,024 --> 00:24:00,069
Smeagol did it once. He can do it again.

230
00:24:03,406 --> 00:24:06,076
It's ours!

231
00:24:06,242 --> 00:24:08,912
Ours!

232
00:24:10,038 --> 00:24:12,908
We must get the precious. We must get it back.

233
00:24:13,082 --> 00:24:16,498
Patience! Patience, my love.

234
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:21,047
First we must lead them to her.

235
00:24:21,924 --> 00:24:26,918
We lead them to the Winding Stair.

236
00:24:27,096 --> 00:24:29,765
Yes, the stairs. And then?

237
00:24:29,932 --> 00:24:32,932
Up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go...

238
00:24:33,102 --> 00:24:39,519
until we come to the tunnel.

239
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,020
And when they go in...

240
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:45,982
there's no coming out.

241
00:24:46,907 --> 00:24:49,778
She's always hungry.

242
00:24:50,536 --> 00:24:54,746
She always needs to feed.

243
00:24:54,914 --> 00:24:56,325
She must eat.

244
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,622
All she gets is filthy Orcses.

245
00:24:58,794 --> 00:25:01,545
And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, precious?

246
00:25:02,172 --> 00:25:03,796
No.

247
00:25:03,965 --> 00:25:08,674
Not very nice at all, my love.

248
00:25:08,845 --> 00:25:11,632
She hungers for sweeter meats.

249
00:25:11,806 --> 00:25:13,633
Hobbit meat.

250
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:18,636
And when she throws away the
bones and the empty clothes...

251
00:25:18,813 --> 00:25:21,897
then we will find it.

252
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:26,394
And take it for me!

253
00:25:28,155 --> 00:25:29,566
For us.

254
00:25:30,074 --> 00:25:33,075
Yes. We meant "for us."

255
00:25:33,243 --> 00:25:36,695
Gollum. Gollum.

256
00:25:36,872 --> 00:25:41,368
The precious will be ours...

257
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:46,039
once the Hobbitses are dead!

258
00:25:46,548 --> 00:25:48,007
You treacherous little toad!

259
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:53,007
No! No! Master!

260
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:54,804
No, Sam! Leave him alone!

261
00:25:55,682 --> 00:25:58,351
I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us.

262
00:25:58,517 --> 00:26:02,681
Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

263
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,763
He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...

264
00:26:06,943 --> 00:26:08,521
who hates Smeagol...

265
00:26:08,694 --> 00:26:11,482
and who makes up nasty lies.

266
00:26:11,656 --> 00:26:14,324
You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!

267
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,980
Sam!

268
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:18,657
Call me a liar? You're a liar!

269
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:23,535
- You scare him off, we're lost!
- I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.

270
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:26,876
- I won't wait around for him to kill us!
- I'm not sending him away.

271
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:28,541
You don't see it, do you?

272
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:30,374
He's a villain.

273
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:35,001
We can't do this by ourselves,
Sam. Not without a guide.

274
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:38,716
I need you on my side.

275
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:41,841
I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

276
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:46,307
I know, Sam. I know.

277
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:48,849
Trust me.

278
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:51,397
Come, Smeagol.

279
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:00,802
What time is it?

280
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,633
Not yet dawn.

281
00:28:11,563 --> 00:28:14,599
I dreamed I saw a great wave...

282
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:18,773
climbing over green lands and above the hills.

283
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,485
I stood upon the brink.

284
00:28:23,408 --> 00:28:26,575
It was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet.

285
00:28:28,496 --> 00:28:31,283
A light shone behind me...

286
00:28:31,916 --> 00:28:34,324
but I could not turn.

287
00:28:34,502 --> 00:28:37,918
I could only stand there, waiting.

288
00:28:39,382 --> 00:28:42,086
Night changes many thoughts.

289
00:28:42,468 --> 00:28:44,627
Sleep, Eowyn.

290
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:47,421
Sleep...

291
00:28:50,142 --> 00:28:52,016
while you can.

292
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:18,456
The stars are veiled.

293
00:29:19,463 --> 00:29:22,961
Something stirs in the east.

294
00:29:23,633 --> 00:29:26,752
A sleepless malice.

295
00:29:28,763 --> 00:29:31,550
The Eye of the enemy is moving.

296
00:29:44,987 --> 00:29:47,692
What are you doing?

297
00:29:52,327 --> 00:29:53,786
Pippin!

298
00:30:01,295 --> 00:30:03,038
Pippin?

299
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:17,262
Pippin.

300
00:30:17,936 --> 00:30:20,605
- What, are you mad?
- I just want to look at it.

301
00:30:20,772 --> 00:30:21,886
Just one more time.

302
00:30:22,148 --> 00:30:24,224
Put it back.

303
00:30:34,494 --> 00:30:36,285
Pippin.

304
00:30:42,793 --> 00:30:44,288
No!

305
00:30:49,382 --> 00:30:50,628
Pippin.

306
00:30:53,971 --> 00:30:55,169
He is here.

307
00:30:55,347 --> 00:30:57,635
I see you.

308
00:31:00,643 --> 00:31:02,268
Pippin!

309
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,661
Help! Gandalf, help!

310
00:31:21,414 --> 00:31:23,287
Someone help him!

311
00:31:29,672 --> 00:31:30,870
Pippin!

312
00:31:32,008 --> 00:31:33,252
Fool of a Took!

313
00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:56,569
Look at me.

314
00:31:58,533 --> 00:32:02,661
Gandalf, forgive me.

315
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:04,703
Look at me.

316
00:32:04,872 --> 00:32:06,700
What did you see?

317
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:12,287
A tree.

318
00:32:13,256 --> 00:32:15,130
There was a white tree...

319
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,794
in a courtyard of stone.

320
00:32:19,596 --> 00:32:20,875
It was dead.

321
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:26,885
The city was burning.

322
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:30,430
Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?

323
00:32:31,107 --> 00:32:33,145
I saw...

324
00:32:36,528 --> 00:32:37,904
I saw him.

325
00:32:40,908 --> 00:32:43,150
I could hear his voice in my head.

326
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:45,734
And what did you tell him?

327
00:32:45,912 --> 00:32:47,739
Speak!

328
00:32:51,918 --> 00:32:55,084
He asked me my name. I didn't answer.

329
00:32:55,255 --> 00:32:56,714
He hurt me.

330
00:32:56,882 --> 00:32:59,337
What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?

331
00:33:02,846 --> 00:33:05,301
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.

332
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,382
A fool...

333
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,848
but an honest fool he remains.

334
00:33:11,312 --> 00:33:14,847
He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.

335
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,272
We've been strangely fortunate.

336
00:33:18,444 --> 00:33:22,311
Pippin saw in the palantir a
glimpse of the enemy's plan.

337
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:27,190
Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.

338
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:31,535
His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing.

339
00:33:31,707 --> 00:33:34,032
He knows the heir of Elendil has come forth.

340
00:33:34,209 --> 00:33:36,332
Men are not as weak as he supposed.

341
00:33:36,503 --> 00:33:40,287
There is courage still, strength
enough perhaps to challenge him.

342
00:33:40,507 --> 00:33:42,381
Sauron fears this.

343
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:46,880
He will not risk the peoples of
Middle-earth uniting under one banner.

344
00:33:48,056 --> 00:33:50,464
He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground...

345
00:33:50,642 --> 00:33:54,141
before he sees a king return to the throne of Men.

346
00:33:54,312 --> 00:33:58,226
If the beacons of Gondor are
lit, Rohan must be ready for war.

347
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,356
Tell me...

348
00:34:01,527 --> 00:34:05,311
why should we ride to the aid of
those who did not come to ours?

349
00:34:09,201 --> 00:34:11,028
What do we owe Gondor?

350
00:34:12,162 --> 00:34:14,202
- I will go.
- No!

351
00:34:14,373 --> 00:34:17,539
- They must be warned.
- They will be.

352
00:34:20,963 --> 00:34:23,501
You must come to Minas Tirith by another road.

353
00:34:24,049 --> 00:34:28,510
Follow the river. Look to the black ships.

354
00:34:29,471 --> 00:34:31,429
Understand this:

355
00:34:31,598 --> 00:34:35,263
Things are now in motion that cannot be undone.

356
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,845
I ride for Minas Tirith...

357
00:34:41,107 --> 00:34:43,777
and I won't be going alone.

358
00:34:45,528 --> 00:34:49,193
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,
Peregrin Took, you are the worst.

359
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,860
Hurry! Hurry!

360
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,779
Where are we going?

361
00:34:54,954 --> 00:34:56,199
Why did you look?

362
00:34:56,373 --> 00:34:59,123
Why do you always have to look?

363
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:02,375
- I don't know. I can't help it.
- You never can.

364
00:35:02,837 --> 00:35:04,247
I'm sorry, all right?

365
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:09,258
- I won't do it again.
- Don't you understand?

366
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:11,967
The enemy thinks you have the Ring.

367
00:35:12,137 --> 00:35:15,885
He's going to be looking for you,
Pip. They have to get you out of here.

368
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:19,979
And you...? You're coming with me?

369
00:35:22,189 --> 00:35:23,599
Merry?

370
00:35:23,774 --> 00:35:25,054
Come on.

371
00:35:30,572 --> 00:35:31,948
How far is Minas Tirith?

372
00:35:32,115 --> 00:35:34,736
Three days' ride, as the Nazgul flies.

373
00:35:34,909 --> 00:35:38,409
And you better hope we don't
have one of those on our tail.

374
00:35:39,122 --> 00:35:40,616
Here.

375
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,582
Something for the road.

376
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,416
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

377
00:35:45,587 --> 00:35:49,584
I know you've run out. You smoke too much, Pippin.

378
00:35:49,757 --> 00:35:52,248
But... But we'll see each other soon.

379
00:35:55,596 --> 00:35:58,087
- Won't we?
- I don't know.

380
00:36:00,101 --> 00:36:02,140
I don't know what's going to happen.

381
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:04,019
- Merry.
- Run, Shadowfax.

382
00:36:04,188 --> 00:36:05,646
Show us the meaning of haste.

383
00:36:05,814 --> 00:36:07,724
Merry!

384
00:36:18,202 --> 00:36:19,316
Merry!

385
00:36:29,796 --> 00:36:31,290
He's always followed me...

386
00:36:31,965 --> 00:36:34,004
everywhere I went...

387
00:36:34,342 --> 00:36:36,133
since before we were tweens.

388
00:36:37,303 --> 00:36:41,217
I would get him into the worst sort of trouble...

389
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,466
but I was always there to get him out.

390
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:47,811
Now he's gone.

391
00:36:49,482 --> 00:36:52,399
Just like Frodo and Sam.

392
00:36:53,027 --> 00:36:55,778
One thing I have learned about Hobbits:

393
00:36:55,946 --> 00:36:57,607
They're a most hardy folk.

394
00:36:58,156 --> 00:37:01,857
Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

395
00:37:16,341 --> 00:37:18,629
Take her by the safest road.

396
00:37:18,802 --> 00:37:21,293
A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens.

397
00:37:21,471 --> 00:37:25,338
It waits to carry her across the sea.

398
00:37:25,516 --> 00:37:28,886
The last journey of Arwen Undomiel.

399
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,585
There is nothing for you here...

400
00:38:38,087 --> 00:38:40,293
only death.

401
00:38:47,596 --> 00:38:48,877
Lady Arwen...

402
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:51,715
we cannot delay.

403
00:38:54,186 --> 00:38:55,430
My lady!

404
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:17,452
- Tell me what you have seen.
- Arwen.

405
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,582
You have the gift of foresight.

406
00:39:19,752 --> 00:39:21,544
What did you see?

407
00:39:22,171 --> 00:39:25,505
I looked into your future, and I saw death.

408
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,172
But there is also life.

409
00:39:30,096 --> 00:39:34,140
You saw there was a child. You saw my son.

410
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:37,304
That future is almost gone.

411
00:39:37,478 --> 00:39:39,470
But it is not lost.

412
00:39:42,066 --> 00:39:44,272
Nothing is certain.

413
00:39:45,986 --> 00:39:48,691
Some things are certain.

414
00:39:52,493 --> 00:39:55,327
If I leave him now...

415
00:39:55,495 --> 00:39:58,116
I will regret it forever.

416
00:39:59,207 --> 00:40:01,532
It is time.

417
00:40:06,797 --> 00:40:10,581
From the ashes a fire shall be woken

418
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,176
A light from the shadow shall spring

419
00:40:14,346 --> 00:40:17,632
Renewed shall be blade that was broken

420
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:28,227
The crownless again shall be king

421
00:40:31,989 --> 00:40:34,028
Re-forge the sword.

422
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,604
Your hands are cold.

423
00:41:14,988 --> 00:41:18,109
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.

424
00:41:21,537 --> 00:41:23,446
This was my choice.

425
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,579
Whether by your will or not...

426
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:33,213
there is no ship now that can bear me hence.

427
00:42:20,427 --> 00:42:23,263
We've just passed into the realm of Gondor.

428
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,141
Minas Tirith.

429
00:42:37,736 --> 00:42:40,061
City of kings.

430
00:43:11,435 --> 00:43:13,227
Make way!

431
00:43:42,423 --> 00:43:44,251
It's the tree.

432
00:43:44,425 --> 00:43:46,085
Gandalf. Gandalf.

433
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,502
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.

434
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:50,506
The tree of the king.

435
00:43:50,681 --> 00:43:53,351
Lord Denethor, however, is not king.

436
00:43:53,518 --> 00:43:56,186
He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne.

437
00:43:56,937 --> 00:44:00,472
Now listen carefully. Lord
Denethor is Boromir's father.

438
00:44:01,025 --> 00:44:04,809
To give him news of his beloved
son's death would be most unwise.

439
00:44:05,278 --> 00:44:08,730
And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.

440
00:44:09,616 --> 00:44:12,368
And say nothing of Aragorn either.

441
00:44:14,204 --> 00:44:18,071
In fact, it's better if you
don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

442
00:44:48,238 --> 00:44:54,738
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
lord and steward of Gondor.

443
00:45:00,249 --> 00:45:04,957
I come with tidings in this
dark hour, and with counsel.

444
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,290
Perhaps you come to explain this.

445
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:19,472
Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead.

446
00:45:33,948 --> 00:45:36,948
Boromir died to save us...

447
00:45:37,118 --> 00:45:38,778
my kinsman and me.

448
00:45:38,953 --> 00:45:42,452
- He fell defending us from many foes.
- Pippin.

449
00:45:47,962 --> 00:45:51,412
I offer you my service, such as it is...

450
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:53,958
in payment of this debt.

451
00:45:56,136 --> 00:45:59,469
This is my first command to you.

452
00:46:00,182 --> 00:46:03,633
How did you escape and my son did not...

453
00:46:03,976 --> 00:46:06,302
so mighty a man as he was?

454
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:10,313
The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow...

455
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:12,476
and Boromir was pierced by many.

456
00:46:16,615 --> 00:46:18,322
Get up.

457
00:46:18,491 --> 00:46:23,117
My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir...

458
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:25,322
but it is not now.

459
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,246
War is coming.

460
00:46:28,584 --> 00:46:32,996
The enemy is on your doorstep.
As steward, you are charged...

461
00:46:33,172 --> 00:46:37,335
with the defense of this city.
Where are Gondor's armies?

462
00:46:37,509 --> 00:46:42,385
You still have friends. You
are not alone in this fight.

463
00:46:42,556 --> 00:46:47,052
Send word to Theoden of Rohan. Light the beacons.

464
00:46:48,645 --> 00:46:52,180
You think you are wise, Mithrandir.

465
00:46:52,357 --> 00:46:55,394
Yet for all your subtleties, you have not wisdom.

466
00:46:57,529 --> 00:47:01,692
Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind?

467
00:47:01,866 --> 00:47:04,951
I have seen more than you know.

468
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,323
With your left hand you would
use me as a shield against Mordor.

469
00:47:08,498 --> 00:47:11,368
And with your right you'd seek to supplant me.

470
00:47:11,542 --> 00:47:15,243
I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan.

471
00:47:15,421 --> 00:47:21,376
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears
of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

472
00:47:21,552 --> 00:47:26,380
And I tell you now, I will not bow
to this Ranger from the North...

473
00:47:26,557 --> 00:47:31,053
last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship.

474
00:47:31,228 --> 00:47:37,064
Authority is not given to you to
deny the return of the king, steward.

475
00:47:37,234 --> 00:47:41,647
The rule of Gondor is mine and no other's.

476
00:47:46,827 --> 00:47:48,618
Come.

477
00:47:56,545 --> 00:47:59,118
All has turned to vain ambition.

478
00:47:59,297 --> 00:48:02,748
He would even use his grief as a cloak.

479
00:48:05,637 --> 00:48:08,423
A thousand years this city has stood.

480
00:48:09,516 --> 00:48:11,923
Now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall.

481
00:48:13,144 --> 00:48:15,350
And the White Tree, the tree of the king...

482
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:17,064
will never bloom again.

483
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:20,600
- Why are they still guarding it?
- They guard it because they have hope.

484
00:48:20,777 --> 00:48:23,943
A faint and fading hope that one day it will flower.

485
00:48:24,113 --> 00:48:28,858
That a king will come and this
city will be as it once was...

486
00:48:29,035 --> 00:48:31,951
before it fell into decay.

487
00:48:32,121 --> 00:48:35,371
The old wisdom borne out of the West was forsaken.

488
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:39,834
Kings made tombs more splendid
than the houses of the living...

489
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:41,954
and counted the old names of their descent...

490
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:44,917
dearer than the names of their sons.

491
00:48:45,092 --> 00:48:50,132
Childless lords sat in aged
halls, musing on heraldry...

492
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:55,644
or in high, cold towers, asking questions of the stars.

493
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:59,594
And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.

494
00:49:00,565 --> 00:49:02,890
The line of kings failed.

495
00:49:03,609 --> 00:49:05,981
The White Tree withered.

496
00:49:06,695 --> 00:49:10,859
The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men.

497
00:49:21,585 --> 00:49:22,830
Mordor.

498
00:49:23,337 --> 00:49:27,002
Yes, there it lies.

499
00:49:27,841 --> 00:49:31,175
This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow.

500
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:34,839
A storm is coming.

501
00:49:35,515 --> 00:49:38,433
This is not the weather of the world.

502
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:40,808
This is a device of Sauron's making.

503
00:49:40,979 --> 00:49:44,727
A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host.

504
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,771
The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight...

505
00:49:47,944 --> 00:49:49,771
so he covers the face of the sun...

506
00:49:49,946 --> 00:49:53,694
to ease their passage along the road to war.

507
00:49:53,867 --> 00:49:57,152
When the Shadow of Mordor reaches this city...

508
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,578
it will begin.

509
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,826
Well...

510
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,537
Minas Tirith...

511
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:07,873
very impressive.

512
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,668
- So where are we off to next?
- Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.

513
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,048
There's no leaving this city.

514
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,590
Help must come to us.

515
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,770
It must be getting near teatime.

516
00:50:22,936 --> 00:50:26,637
Leastways, it would be in decent
places where there is still teatime.

517
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:30,398
We're not in decent places.

518
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:37,194
Mr. Frodo?

519
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:41,442
What is it?

520
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:46,287
It's just a feeling.

521
00:50:48,711 --> 00:50:50,870
I don't think I'll be coming back.

522
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,922
Yes, you will. Of course you will.

523
00:50:58,554 --> 00:51:00,427
That's just morbid thinking.

524
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:03,345
We're going there and back again...

525
00:51:03,517 --> 00:51:05,806
just like Mr. Bilbo.

526
00:51:06,771 --> 00:51:08,894
You'll see.

527
00:51:17,072 --> 00:51:20,690
I think these lands were once
part of the kingdom of Gondor.

528
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:29,124
Long ago, when there was a king.

529
00:51:49,771 --> 00:51:52,605
Mr. Frodo, look.

530
00:51:54,232 --> 00:51:56,984
The king has got a crown again.

531
00:52:08,122 --> 00:52:12,368
Come on, Hobbits! Mustn't stop now. This way.

532
00:52:29,225 --> 00:52:33,270
So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position.

533
00:52:33,437 --> 00:52:37,685
I mean, they don't actually
expect me to do any fighting.

534
00:52:38,526 --> 00:52:41,776
- Do they?
- You're in the service of the steward now.

535
00:52:41,945 --> 00:52:45,315
You'll have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took.

536
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:51,861
Ridiculous Hobbit.

537
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,246
Guard of the Citadel.

538
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,586
Thank you.

539
00:53:15,978 --> 00:53:18,220
There's no more stars.

540
00:53:18,731 --> 00:53:19,930
Is it time?

541
00:53:21,109 --> 00:53:22,852
Yes.

542
00:53:25,488 --> 00:53:27,148
It's so quiet.

543
00:53:28,157 --> 00:53:32,404
It's the deep breath before the plunge.

544
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:36,449
I don't want to be in a battle...

545
00:53:37,292 --> 00:53:42,249
but waiting on the edge of one
I can't escape is even worse.

546
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:49,418
Is there any hope, Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?

547
00:53:50,762 --> 00:53:53,882
There never was much hope.

548
00:53:55,851 --> 00:53:57,594
Just a fool's hope.

549
00:54:03,483 --> 00:54:06,270
Our enemy is ready.

550
00:54:06,444 --> 00:54:09,114
His full strength's gathered.

551
00:54:09,281 --> 00:54:12,779
Not only Orcs, but Men as well.

552
00:54:12,951 --> 00:54:15,987
Legions of Haradrim from the south...

553
00:54:16,162 --> 00:54:18,866
mercenaries from the coast.

554
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,613
All will answer Mordor's call.

555
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:23,334
Come on.

556
00:54:24,462 --> 00:54:27,795
This will be the end of Gondor as we know it.

557
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:31,334
Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.

558
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:36,632
If the river is taken, if the
garrison at Osgiliath falls...

559
00:54:36,807 --> 00:54:40,472
the last defense of this city will be gone.

560
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:44,689
But we have the White Wizard.
That's got to count for something.

561
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:52,148
Gandalf?

562
00:54:55,867 --> 00:54:59,532
Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant...

563
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:03,828
the one who will lead Mordor's armies in war.

564
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,160
The one they say no living man can kill.

565
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:12,331
The Witch King of Angmar.

566
00:55:13,425 --> 00:55:15,798
You've met him before.

567
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:19,044
He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

568
00:55:25,605 --> 00:55:28,309
He is the lord of the Nazgul...

569
00:55:28,774 --> 00:55:31,230
the greatest of the Nine.

570
00:55:31,401 --> 00:55:35,020
Minas Morgul is his lair.

571
00:55:38,492 --> 00:55:42,026
The Dead City.

572
00:55:42,203 --> 00:55:47,411
Very nasty place. Full of enemies.

573
00:55:54,633 --> 00:55:56,791
Quick. Quick.

574
00:55:56,968 --> 00:56:00,965
They will see. They will see.

575
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:15,521
Come away. Come away. Look, we have found it.

576
00:56:15,695 --> 00:56:19,562
The way into Mordor.

577
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:24,070
The secret stair.

578
00:56:24,494 --> 00:56:26,866
Climb.

579
00:56:47,141 --> 00:56:49,893
- No, Mr. Frodo!
- Not that way!

580
00:56:54,732 --> 00:56:57,603
- What's it doing?
- No.

581
00:56:57,777 --> 00:57:00,861
- They're calling me.
- No.

582
00:57:30,517 --> 00:57:33,471
Hide! Hide!

583
00:58:17,021 --> 00:58:19,856
I can feel his blade.

584
00:58:31,534 --> 00:58:33,658
We come to it at last.

585
00:58:35,496 --> 00:58:38,367
The great battle of our time.

586
00:59:17,538 --> 00:59:20,787
Come away, Hobbits. We climb. We must climb.

587
00:59:30,675 --> 00:59:33,676
The board is set.

588
00:59:33,844 --> 00:59:36,383
The pieces are moving.

589
00:59:38,933 --> 00:59:41,603
Up, up, up the stairs we go.

590
00:59:41,769 --> 00:59:44,438
And then it's into the tunnel.

591
00:59:44,605 --> 00:59:47,809
Hey, what's in this tunnel?

592
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:51,110
You listen to me, and you listen good and proper.

593
00:59:51,278 --> 00:59:54,196
Anything happens to him, you have me to answer to.

594
00:59:54,364 --> 00:59:55,942
One sniff something's not right...

595
00:59:56,117 --> 00:59:59,283
one hair stands up on the back of my head, it's over.

596
00:59:59,494 --> 01:00:02,164
No more slinker. No more stinker.

597
01:00:02,497 --> 01:00:05,119
You're gone. Got it?

598
01:00:06,001 --> 01:00:07,993
I'm watching you.

599
01:00:13,341 --> 01:00:15,334
What was that about?

600
01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:17,917
Nothing. Just clearing something up.

601
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,431
Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task now to be done.

602
01:00:27,605 --> 01:00:32,183
Another opportunity for one of the
Shire-folk to prove their great worth.

603
01:00:37,031 --> 01:00:38,609
You must not fail me.

604
01:01:12,857 --> 01:01:15,941
It's been very quiet across the river.

605
01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:18,435
The Orcs are lying low.

606
01:01:18,613 --> 01:01:20,605
The garrison may have moved out.

607
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:24,445
We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.

608
01:01:24,619 --> 01:01:27,904
If the Orcs attack from the
north, we'll have some warning.

609
01:01:53,229 --> 01:01:54,428
Quiet.

610
01:01:58,526 --> 01:02:00,484
We need 10 more.

611
01:02:21,799 --> 01:02:23,341
Kill him!

612
01:02:40,651 --> 01:02:43,058
They're not coming from the north.

613
01:02:44,488 --> 01:02:48,817
To the river. Quick. Quick. Go. Come on.

614
01:02:52,287 --> 01:02:53,864
Faster.

615
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:09,382
Draw swords.

616
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:06,513
Hold! Hold them!

617
01:05:26,811 --> 01:05:28,686
What?

618
01:05:41,242 --> 01:05:42,653
Amon Din

619
01:05:48,458 --> 01:05:51,494
The beacon. The beacon of Amon Din is lit.

620
01:05:54,755 --> 01:05:58,967
Hope is kindled.

621
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:35,727
The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit!

622
01:07:36,938 --> 01:07:38,562
Gondor calls for aid.

623
01:07:49,074 --> 01:07:51,992
And Rohan will answer.

624
01:07:52,411 --> 01:07:55,198
Muster the Rohirrim.

625
01:08:10,303 --> 01:08:12,261
Assemble the army at Dunharrow.

626
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:16,808
As many men as can be found. You have two days.

627
01:08:16,976 --> 01:08:22,267
On the third, we ride for Gondor and war.

628
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:24,561
- Forward.
- Very good, sir.

629
01:08:24,734 --> 01:08:26,062
- Gamling.
- My lord.

630
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:27,813
Make haste across the Riddermark.

631
01:08:27,988 --> 01:08:30,110
Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow.

632
01:08:30,281 --> 01:08:31,859
I will.

633
01:08:35,953 --> 01:08:39,120
- Will you ride with us?
- Just to the encampment.

634
01:08:39,289 --> 01:08:43,204
It's tradition for the women of
the court to farewell the men.

635
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:51,668
The men have found their captain.

636
01:08:51,844 --> 01:08:55,177
They will follow you into battle, even to death.

637
01:08:55,347 --> 01:08:56,925
You have given us hope.

638
01:09:00,143 --> 01:09:02,101
Excuse me.

639
01:09:03,438 --> 01:09:04,932
I have a sword.

640
01:09:05,232 --> 01:09:06,607
Please accept it.

641
01:09:07,734 --> 01:09:12,230
I offer you my service, Theoden King.

642
01:09:15,658 --> 01:09:17,734
And gladly I accept it.

643
01:09:18,828 --> 01:09:22,908
You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan.

644
01:09:27,795 --> 01:09:28,993
Horse-Men.

645
01:09:29,672 --> 01:09:35,295
I wish I could muster a legion of
Dwarves, fully armed and filthy.

646
01:09:35,678 --> 01:09:38,632
Your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war.

647
01:09:38,806 --> 01:09:42,222
I fear war already marches on their own lands.

648
01:10:00,702 --> 01:10:04,153
So it is before the walls of Minas Tirith...

649
01:10:04,331 --> 01:10:08,198
the doom of our time will be decided.

650
01:10:10,795 --> 01:10:16,335
Now is the hour. Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.

651
01:10:16,509 --> 01:10:20,043
Now, fulfill them all. To lord and land!

652
01:11:03,137 --> 01:11:05,095
Faramir!

653
01:11:11,395 --> 01:11:15,096
We can't hold them. The city is lost.

654
01:11:15,691 --> 01:11:18,775
Tell the men to break cover. We ride for Minas Tirith.

655
01:11:27,536 --> 01:11:29,778
Nazgul.

656
01:11:32,166 --> 01:11:34,621
Take cover!

657
01:11:34,793 --> 01:11:37,331
Nazgul!

658
01:11:37,504 --> 01:11:41,169
Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!

659
01:11:47,764 --> 01:11:49,638
Fall back!

660
01:11:56,689 --> 01:12:01,268
- Retreat! Retreat!
- Run for your lives!

661
01:12:25,509 --> 01:12:29,838
The age of Men is over.

662
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:35,636
The time of the Orc has come.

663
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:40,346
- Keep going.
- It's the Nazgul.

664
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,355
Take cover, my lord!

665
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:45,981
It's coming!

666
01:12:51,534 --> 01:12:54,903
- It's Mithrandir.
- The White Rider!

667
01:13:34,868 --> 01:13:36,243
Pull!

668
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:56,377
Mithrandir.

669
01:13:56,555 --> 01:13:58,299
They broke through our defenses.

670
01:13:58,474 --> 01:14:00,680
They've taken the bridge and the west bank.

671
01:14:01,769 --> 01:14:05,932
- Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.
- It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.

672
01:14:06,106 --> 01:14:10,649
- Long has he foreseen this doom.
- Foreseen and done nothing.

673
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:16,439
Faramir?

674
01:14:18,368 --> 01:14:22,200
This is not the first Halfling
to have crossed your path.

675
01:14:22,372 --> 01:14:24,578
No.

676
01:14:25,917 --> 01:14:27,459
You've seen Frodo and Sam?

677
01:14:28,336 --> 01:14:31,752
- Where? When?
- In Ithilien.

678
01:14:31,923 --> 01:14:33,999
Not two days ago.

679
01:14:34,467 --> 01:14:38,927
Gandalf, they're taking the road to the Morgul Vale.

680
01:14:39,639 --> 01:14:42,260
And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.

681
01:14:44,477 --> 01:14:46,849
What does that mean?

682
01:14:47,021 --> 01:14:51,931
- What's wrong?
- Faramir, tell me everything.

683
01:14:52,109 --> 01:14:54,148
Tell me all you know.

684
01:14:55,321 --> 01:14:58,736
This is how you would serve your city?

685
01:14:58,908 --> 01:15:02,193
You would risk its utter ruin?

686
01:15:03,245 --> 01:15:04,822
I did what I judged to be right.

687
01:15:05,538 --> 01:15:08,539
What you judged to be right.

688
01:15:09,167 --> 01:15:15,040
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor
in the hands of a witless Halfling.

689
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:23,838
It should have been brought back
to the Citadel to be kept safe.

690
01:15:25,475 --> 01:15:27,017
Hidden.

691
01:15:27,435 --> 01:15:30,187
Dark and deep in the vaults...

692
01:15:30,354 --> 01:15:32,513
not to be used.

693
01:15:36,694 --> 01:15:41,570
Unless at the uttermost end of need.

694
01:15:42,033 --> 01:15:44,072
I would not use the Ring.

695
01:15:44,243 --> 01:15:47,328
Not if Minas Tirith were falling
in ruin and I alone could save her.

696
01:15:47,663 --> 01:15:52,490
Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious...

697
01:15:52,668 --> 01:15:54,910
as a king of old.

698
01:15:56,713 --> 01:16:00,462
Boromir would have remembered his father's need.

699
01:16:00,884 --> 01:16:03,340
He would have brought me a kingly gift.

700
01:16:03,553 --> 01:16:06,091
Boromir would not have brought the Ring.

701
01:16:06,515 --> 01:16:09,634
He would have stretched out his hand to
this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.

702
01:16:09,809 --> 01:16:12,051
- You know nothing of this matter!
- He would have kept it for his own.

703
01:16:13,939 --> 01:16:16,097
And when he returned...

704
01:16:17,233 --> 01:16:18,893
you would not have known your son.

705
01:16:19,068 --> 01:16:21,606
Boromir was loyal to me!

706
01:16:21,779 --> 01:16:24,352
Not some wizard's pupil!

707
01:16:32,498 --> 01:16:33,826
Father?

708
01:16:46,512 --> 01:16:48,421
My son.

709
01:17:14,664 --> 01:17:16,039
Leave me.

710
01:17:49,614 --> 01:17:52,152
Careful, master. Careful.

711
01:17:52,492 --> 01:17:55,410
Very far to fall.

712
01:17:57,914 --> 01:18:01,828
Very dangerous are the stairs.

713
01:18:04,504 --> 01:18:07,042
Come, master.

714
01:18:12,846 --> 01:18:16,012
Come to Smeagol.

715
01:18:22,354 --> 01:18:23,848
Mr. Frodo.

716
01:18:24,857 --> 01:18:26,399
Get back, you!

717
01:18:26,567 --> 01:18:28,773
Don't touch him!

718
01:18:32,906 --> 01:18:35,741
Why does he hates poor Smeagol?

719
01:18:35,909 --> 01:18:39,610
What has Smeagol ever done to him?

720
01:18:39,788 --> 01:18:42,160
Master?

721
01:18:42,957 --> 01:18:46,409
Master carries heavy burden.

722
01:18:46,586 --> 01:18:52,007
Smeagol knows. Heavy, heavy burden.

723
01:18:52,175 --> 01:18:55,425
Fat one cannot know.

724
01:18:57,472 --> 01:19:00,223
Smeagol look after master.

725
01:19:01,434 --> 01:19:03,641
He wants it.

726
01:19:03,811 --> 01:19:08,354
He needs it. Smeagol sees it in his eye.

727
01:19:08,524 --> 01:19:13,980
Very soon he will ask you for it. You will see.

728
01:19:14,155 --> 01:19:18,022
The fat one will take it from you.

729
01:19:25,248 --> 01:19:29,578
Send forth all legions.

730
01:19:29,753 --> 01:19:33,798
Do not stop the attack until the city is taken.

731
01:19:34,508 --> 01:19:37,628
Slay them all.

732
01:19:39,304 --> 01:19:45,093
- What of the wizard?
- I will break him.

733
01:19:48,438 --> 01:19:50,845
Where are Theoden's riders?

734
01:19:51,023 --> 01:19:53,597
Will Rohan's army come?

735
01:19:53,776 --> 01:19:56,018
Mithrandir.

736
01:19:57,071 --> 01:20:00,938
Courage is the best defense that you have now.

737
01:20:05,747 --> 01:20:08,451
What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?

738
01:20:10,542 --> 01:20:16,248
What service can a Hobbit
offer such a great lord of Men?

739
01:20:16,423 --> 01:20:17,918
It was well-done.

740
01:20:21,094 --> 01:20:25,139
A generous deed should not
be checked with cold counsel.

741
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:28,429
You are to join the tower guard.

742
01:20:28,977 --> 01:20:31,977
I didn't think they would find
any livery that would fit me.

743
01:20:32,147 --> 01:20:34,602
Once belonged to a young boy of the city.

744
01:20:34,774 --> 01:20:36,316
A very foolish one...

745
01:20:36,484 --> 01:20:40,731
who wasted many hours slaying dragons
instead of attending to his studies.

746
01:20:40,905 --> 01:20:43,657
- This was yours?
- Yes, it was mine.

747
01:20:43,825 --> 01:20:45,616
My father had it made for me.

748
01:20:46,661 --> 01:20:47,990
Well...

749
01:20:48,163 --> 01:20:50,154
I'm taller than you were then.

750
01:20:50,331 --> 01:20:53,665
Though I'm not likely to grow anymore, except sideways.

751
01:20:56,629 --> 01:20:58,669
Never fitted me either.

752
01:20:58,839 --> 01:21:01,675
Boromir was always the soldier.

753
01:21:04,679 --> 01:21:07,086
They were so alike, he and my father.

754
01:21:09,183 --> 01:21:10,808
Proud.

755
01:21:10,976 --> 01:21:12,174
Stubborn even.

756
01:21:13,938 --> 01:21:15,432
But strong.

757
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:20,107
I think you have strength of a different kind.

758
01:21:20,736 --> 01:21:23,191
And one day your father will see it.

759
01:21:27,367 --> 01:21:31,151
Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor...

760
01:21:31,329 --> 01:21:32,824
in peace or war...

761
01:21:33,457 --> 01:21:35,912
in living or dying...

762
01:21:37,294 --> 01:21:38,538
from...

763
01:21:41,214 --> 01:21:44,001
From this hour henceforth...

764
01:21:44,175 --> 01:21:46,084
until my lord release me...

765
01:21:47,595 --> 01:21:49,801
or death take me.

766
01:21:50,389 --> 01:21:52,880
And I shall not forget it...

767
01:21:53,058 --> 01:21:56,428
nor fail to reward that which is given.

768
01:22:04,028 --> 01:22:06,316
Fealty with love.

769
01:22:07,405 --> 01:22:09,066
Valor with honor.

770
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:13,992
Disloyalty with vengeance.

771
01:22:22,629 --> 01:22:26,709
I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses...

772
01:22:26,883 --> 01:22:29,635
defenses that your brother long held intact.

773
01:22:29,802 --> 01:22:32,293
- What would you have me do?
- I will not yield...

774
01:22:32,472 --> 01:22:35,259
the river in Pelennor unfought.

775
01:22:35,433 --> 01:22:37,093
Osgiliath must be retaken.

776
01:22:37,268 --> 01:22:39,308
My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

777
01:22:39,979 --> 01:22:42,766
Much must be risked in war.

778
01:22:45,401 --> 01:22:49,351
Is there a captain here who still
has the courage to do his lord's will?

779
01:22:55,577 --> 01:22:58,827
You wish now that our places had been exchanged...

780
01:22:59,790 --> 01:23:02,625
that I had died and Boromir had lived.

781
01:23:06,046 --> 01:23:07,789
Yes.

782
01:23:08,465 --> 01:23:10,671
I wish that.

783
01:23:19,058 --> 01:23:21,549
Since you were robbed of Boromir...

784
01:23:23,396 --> 01:23:26,314
I will do what I can in his stead.

785
01:23:34,490 --> 01:23:38,950
If I should return, think better of me, Father.

786
01:23:41,038 --> 01:23:44,656
That will depend on the manner of your return.

787
01:25:07,956 --> 01:25:10,281
What are you up to?

788
01:25:10,458 --> 01:25:11,703
Sneaking off, are we?

789
01:25:12,419 --> 01:25:14,245
Sneaking?

790
01:25:15,254 --> 01:25:17,412
Sneaking?

791
01:25:18,841 --> 01:25:22,007
Fat Hobbit is always so polite.

792
01:25:22,178 --> 01:25:27,254
Smeagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find...

793
01:25:27,433 --> 01:25:29,591
and they say "sneak."

794
01:25:30,227 --> 01:25:32,801
Sneak?

795
01:25:33,438 --> 01:25:36,143
Very nice friend. Oh, yes, my precious.

796
01:25:36,316 --> 01:25:38,938
- Very nice, very nice.
- All right. All right!

797
01:25:40,195 --> 01:25:42,401
You just startled me is all.

798
01:25:42,906 --> 01:25:44,733
What were you doing?

799
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:48,490
Sneaking.

800
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:51,955
Fine. Have it your own way.

801
01:25:54,209 --> 01:25:56,700
I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.

802
01:25:57,087 --> 01:25:59,043
We have to be moving on.

803
01:26:04,218 --> 01:26:05,796
It's dark still.

804
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:08,176
It's always dark here.

805
01:26:12,435 --> 01:26:14,343
It's gone!

806
01:26:15,563 --> 01:26:18,433
- The Elven bread.
- What?

807
01:26:18,607 --> 01:26:20,066
That's all we have left.

808
01:26:24,154 --> 01:26:26,646
He took it. He must have!

809
01:26:27,157 --> 01:26:30,408
Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol.

810
01:26:30,577 --> 01:26:33,495
Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread.

811
01:26:33,664 --> 01:26:36,830
You're a lying rat! What did you do with it?!

812
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,542
He doesn't eat it.

813
01:26:39,545 --> 01:26:41,870
- He can't have taken it.
- Look.

814
01:26:42,922 --> 01:26:44,750
What's this?

815
01:26:47,427 --> 01:26:50,761
Crumbs on his jacketses. He took it!

816
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:53,133
He took it.

817
01:26:53,975 --> 01:26:58,186
I seen him. He's always stuffing
his face when master's not looking.

818
01:26:58,355 --> 01:27:00,146
That's a filthy lie!

819
01:27:00,314 --> 01:27:02,521
You stinking, two-faced sneak!

820
01:27:02,691 --> 01:27:03,937
- Sam!
- Call me...

821
01:27:04,110 --> 01:27:05,355
Stop it!

822
01:27:06,362 --> 01:27:07,560
Sam!

823
01:27:08,864 --> 01:27:12,482
- I'll kill him!
- Sam! No!

824
01:27:13,536 --> 01:27:19,075
Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to go so far. I was just so... So angry.

825
01:27:19,249 --> 01:27:21,372
Here, just... Let's
just rest a bit.

826
01:27:21,543 --> 01:27:23,619
- I'm all right.
- No.

827
01:27:23,795 --> 01:27:26,880
No, you're not all right. You're exhausted.

828
01:27:27,048 --> 01:27:29,171
It's that Gollum.

829
01:27:29,342 --> 01:27:31,051
It's this place.

830
01:27:31,219 --> 01:27:33,792
It's that thing around your neck.

831
01:27:37,309 --> 01:27:38,589
I could help a bit.

832
01:27:38,768 --> 01:27:41,437
I could carry it for a while.

833
01:27:41,605 --> 01:27:43,348
Carry it for a while.

834
01:27:43,523 --> 01:27:44,768
I could carry it... I could carry it.

835
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:50,856
Share the load... Share the
load... the load... the load.

836
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:52,229
Get away!

837
01:27:52,407 --> 01:27:53,984
I don't want to keep it.

838
01:27:57,579 --> 01:27:59,570
I just want to help.

839
01:28:01,624 --> 01:28:04,246
See? See?

840
01:28:04,418 --> 01:28:07,834
He wants it for himself.

841
01:28:08,006 --> 01:28:09,713
Shut up, you!

842
01:28:10,257 --> 01:28:12,084
Go away! Get out of here!

843
01:28:12,259 --> 01:28:14,086
No, Sam.

844
01:28:14,261 --> 01:28:15,506
It's you.

845
01:28:19,725 --> 01:28:21,432
I'm sorry, Sam.

846
01:28:23,103 --> 01:28:24,478
But he's a liar.

847
01:28:24,646 --> 01:28:27,315
He's poisoned you against me.

848
01:28:28,734 --> 01:28:30,642
You can't help me anymore.

849
01:28:32,612 --> 01:28:34,485
You don't mean that.

850
01:28:36,992 --> 01:28:38,783
Go home.

851
01:29:58,821 --> 01:30:00,612
Faramir!

852
01:30:00,781 --> 01:30:02,690
Faramir!

853
01:30:04,201 --> 01:30:06,241
Your father's will has turned to madness.

854
01:30:07,412 --> 01:30:09,452
Do not throw away your life so rashly.

855
01:30:10,207 --> 01:30:12,532
Where does my allegiance lie if not here?

856
01:30:13,168 --> 01:30:16,086
This is the city of the Men of Numenor.

857
01:30:16,713 --> 01:30:19,500
I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty...

858
01:30:19,674 --> 01:30:22,878
her memory, her wisdom.

859
01:30:25,263 --> 01:30:28,679
Your father loves you, Faramir.

860
01:30:29,392 --> 01:30:32,393
He will remember it before the end.

861
01:31:42,004 --> 01:31:43,546
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

862
01:31:46,529 --> 01:31:48,023
Well...

863
01:31:48,573 --> 01:31:50,197
yes.

864
01:31:50,909 --> 01:31:54,657
At least, well enough for my own people.

865
01:31:56,289 --> 01:31:58,696
But we have no songs for great halls...

866
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:00,995
and evil times.

867
01:32:01,835 --> 01:32:05,002
And why should your songs be unfit for my halls?

868
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,211
Come, sing me a song.

869
01:32:20,271 --> 01:32:23,604
Home is behind

870
01:32:23,773 --> 01:32:27,522
The world ahead

871
01:32:29,946 --> 01:32:35,782
And there are many paths to tread

872
01:32:37,578 --> 01:32:41,113
Through shadow

873
01:32:41,290 --> 01:32:45,454
To the edge of night

874
01:32:47,129 --> 01:32:52,207
Until the stars are all alight

875
01:32:55,221 --> 01:32:59,549
Mist and shadow

876
01:32:59,725 --> 01:33:04,018
Cloud and shade

877
01:33:06,398 --> 01:33:09,732
All shall fade

878
01:33:12,112 --> 01:33:16,109
All shall

879
01:33:21,872 --> 01:33:24,244
Fade

880
01:33:48,647 --> 01:33:52,099
March! March!

881
01:33:52,276 --> 01:33:57,483
March! March! March!

882
01:34:00,952 --> 01:34:03,277
Make way for the king.

883
01:34:04,789 --> 01:34:06,780
Make way.

884
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:11,290
The king is here.

885
01:34:13,255 --> 01:34:14,879
My lord.

886
01:34:16,133 --> 01:34:18,089
Hail to you, sire.

887
01:34:18,552 --> 01:34:19,749
Grimbold, how many?

888
01:34:19,928 --> 01:34:22,383
I bring 500 men from the Westfold, my lord.

889
01:34:23,348 --> 01:34:26,017
We have 300 more from Fenmarch, Theoden King.

890
01:34:27,143 --> 01:34:31,092
- Where are the riders from Snowborn?
- None have come, my lord.

891
01:34:48,164 --> 01:34:50,287
Six thousand spears.

892
01:34:51,333 --> 01:34:53,326
Less than half of what I'd hoped for.

893
01:34:53,627 --> 01:34:56,996
Six thousand will not be enough
to break the lines of Mordor.

894
01:34:59,758 --> 01:35:01,501
More will come.

895
01:35:01,885 --> 01:35:04,839
Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.

896
01:35:05,013 --> 01:35:07,586
We have till dawn, then we must ride.

897
01:35:27,076 --> 01:35:29,401
The horses are restless...

898
01:35:29,579 --> 01:35:31,073
and the men are quiet.

899
01:35:31,539 --> 01:35:34,658
They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain.

900
01:35:37,128 --> 01:35:39,001
That road there...

901
01:35:39,922 --> 01:35:41,998
where does that lead?

902
01:35:42,758 --> 01:35:46,590
It is the road to the Dimholt,
the door under the mountain.

903
01:35:47,304 --> 01:35:50,305
None who venture there ever return.

904
01:35:51,516 --> 01:35:53,390
That mountain is evil.

905
01:36:16,332 --> 01:36:18,159
Aragorn.

906
01:36:18,918 --> 01:36:20,827
Let's find some food.

907
01:36:37,311 --> 01:36:38,722
There.

908
01:36:39,688 --> 01:36:42,689
A true esquire of Rohan.

909
01:36:46,320 --> 01:36:48,312
I'm ready.

910
01:36:49,907 --> 01:36:51,186
Sorry.

911
01:36:51,367 --> 01:36:53,607
It isn't all that dangerous.

912
01:36:54,119 --> 01:36:56,444
It's not even sharp.

913
01:36:57,122 --> 01:37:00,538
Well, that's no good. You won't
kill many Orcs with a blunt blade.

914
01:37:00,709 --> 01:37:02,203
Come on.

915
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:08,872
To the smithy. Go!

916
01:37:10,343 --> 01:37:12,881
You should not encourage him.

917
01:37:13,054 --> 01:37:15,509
You should not doubt him.

918
01:37:15,682 --> 01:37:18,967
I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm.

919
01:37:21,688 --> 01:37:23,265
Why should Merry be left behind?

920
01:37:23,439 --> 01:37:26,060
He has as much cause to go to war as you.

921
01:37:28,235 --> 01:37:31,401
Why can he not fight for those he loves?

922
01:37:34,658 --> 01:37:37,659
You know as little of war as that Hobbit.

923
01:37:38,912 --> 01:37:40,988
When the fear takes him...

924
01:37:41,164 --> 01:37:46,206
and the blood and the screams and
the horror of battle take hold...

925
01:37:46,586 --> 01:37:48,744
do you think he would stand and fight?

926
01:37:51,299 --> 01:37:52,924
He would flee.

927
01:37:53,093 --> 01:37:55,132
And he would be right to do so.

928
01:37:57,347 --> 01:38:01,297
War is the province of Men, Eowyn.

929
01:38:36,968 --> 01:38:40,669
I choose a mortal life.

930
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:46,470
I wish I could've seen him...

931
01:38:47,604 --> 01:38:50,309
one last time.

932
01:39:01,492 --> 01:39:02,903
Sir?

933
01:39:04,746 --> 01:39:07,319
King Theoden awaits you, my lord.

934
01:39:28,101 --> 01:39:30,058
I take my leave.

935
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:45,946
My lord Elrond.

936
01:39:46,536 --> 01:39:50,035
I come on behalf of one whom I love.

937
01:39:53,125 --> 01:39:55,118
Arwen is dying.

938
01:39:59,923 --> 01:40:03,968
She will not long survive the
evil that now spreads from Mordor.

939
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:08,089
The light of the Evenstar is failing.

940
01:40:08,265 --> 01:40:12,263
As Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.

941
01:40:12,436 --> 01:40:16,184
Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring.

942
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:19,513
The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.

943
01:40:19,902 --> 01:40:21,561
The end has come.

944
01:40:21,946 --> 01:40:24,566
It will not be our end, but his.

945
01:40:25,323 --> 01:40:28,906
You ride to war, but not to victory.

946
01:40:29,911 --> 01:40:33,576
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith, this you know.

947
01:40:33,748 --> 01:40:38,161
But in secret he sends another force
which will attack from the river.

948
01:40:38,628 --> 01:40:42,044
A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the south.

949
01:40:42,674 --> 01:40:44,750
They'll be in the city in two days.

950
01:40:45,259 --> 01:40:48,094
You're outnumbered, Aragorn.

951
01:40:48,804 --> 01:40:50,928
You need more men.

952
01:40:51,307 --> 01:40:53,051
There are none.

953
01:40:54,810 --> 01:40:58,724
There are those who dwell in the mountain.

954
01:41:07,739 --> 01:41:09,898
Murderers...

955
01:41:10,075 --> 01:41:11,486
traitors.

956
01:41:13,954 --> 01:41:16,112
You would call upon them to fight?

957
01:41:16,289 --> 01:41:17,867
They believe in nothing.

958
01:41:18,041 --> 01:41:20,164
They answer to no one.

959
01:41:20,335 --> 01:41:23,419
They will answer to the king of Gondor.

960
01:41:30,553 --> 01:41:35,678
Anduril, the Flame of the West,
forged from the shards of Narsil.

961
01:41:49,989 --> 01:41:54,402
Sauron will not have forgotten the Sword of Elendil.

962
01:42:08,465 --> 01:42:13,210
The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.

963
01:42:13,387 --> 01:42:15,794
The man who can wield the power of this sword...

964
01:42:15,972 --> 01:42:19,839
can summon to him an army more
deadly than any that walks this earth.

965
01:42:21,686 --> 01:42:23,844
Put aside the Ranger.

966
01:42:24,022 --> 01:42:27,355
Become who you were born to be.

967
01:42:27,525 --> 01:42:29,518
Take the Dimholt road.

968
01:42:33,531 --> 01:42:36,318
I give hope to Men.

969
01:42:39,578 --> 01:42:43,707
I keep none for myself.

970
01:42:55,552 --> 01:42:57,213
Why are you doing this?

971
01:42:57,679 --> 01:43:00,882
The war lies to the east. You
cannot leave on the eve of battle.

972
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:05,385
You cannot abandon the men.

973
01:43:06,688 --> 01:43:08,265
Eowyn...

974
01:43:08,439 --> 01:43:10,646
We need you here.

975
01:43:11,776 --> 01:43:13,650
Why have you come?

976
01:43:15,321 --> 01:43:17,278
Do you not know?

977
01:43:26,582 --> 01:43:29,583
It is but a shadow and a thought that you love.

978
01:43:33,505 --> 01:43:35,914
I cannot give you what you seek.

979
01:43:49,438 --> 01:43:53,352
I have wished you joy since first I saw you.

980
01:44:12,502 --> 01:44:14,790
Just where do you think you're off to?

981
01:44:14,962 --> 01:44:16,291
Not this time.

982
01:44:16,464 --> 01:44:18,670
This time you must stay, Gimli.

983
01:44:21,386 --> 01:44:24,220
Have you learned nothing of
the stubbornness of Dwarves?

984
01:44:24,389 --> 01:44:28,053
You might as well accept it.
We're going with you, laddie.

985
01:44:50,372 --> 01:44:52,530
- What's happening?
- Where is he going?

986
01:44:52,874 --> 01:44:54,748
Where's he going?

987
01:44:57,337 --> 01:44:59,376
I don't understand.

988
01:45:03,802 --> 01:45:05,593
Lord Aragorn!

989
01:45:06,012 --> 01:45:08,716
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

990
01:45:09,933 --> 01:45:12,009
He leaves because there is no hope.

991
01:45:12,685 --> 01:45:14,808
He leaves because he must.

992
01:45:14,978 --> 01:45:16,687
Too few have come.

993
01:45:16,856 --> 01:45:19,014
We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.

994
01:45:21,527 --> 01:45:23,187
No...

995
01:45:23,612 --> 01:45:24,857
we cannot.

996
01:45:27,741 --> 01:45:31,525
But we will meet them in battle nonetheless.

997
01:45:45,967 --> 01:45:47,711
I have left instruction.

998
01:45:50,388 --> 01:45:53,638
The people are to follow your rule in my stead.

999
01:46:00,231 --> 01:46:02,473
Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.

1000
01:46:03,735 --> 01:46:06,570
Long may you defend Edoras...

1001
01:46:06,738 --> 01:46:09,063
if the battle goes ill.

1002
01:46:10,157 --> 01:46:13,573
What other duty would you have me do, my lord?

1003
01:46:15,788 --> 01:46:17,745
Duty?

1004
01:46:19,917 --> 01:46:21,245
No.

1005
01:46:29,551 --> 01:46:31,674
I would have you smile again...

1006
01:46:35,098 --> 01:46:40,093
not grieve for those whose time has come.

1007
01:46:44,941 --> 01:46:48,440
You shall live to see these days renewed...

1008
01:46:52,782 --> 01:46:55,533
and no more despair.

1009
01:47:01,749 --> 01:47:05,449
What kind of army would linger in such a place?

1010
01:47:05,628 --> 01:47:07,455
One that is cursed.

1011
01:47:09,424 --> 01:47:11,961
Long ago, the Men of the Mountains swore an oath...

1012
01:47:12,384 --> 01:47:15,136
to the last king of Gondor...

1013
01:47:15,721 --> 01:47:17,298
to come to his aid...

1014
01:47:17,472 --> 01:47:19,180
to fight.

1015
01:47:19,683 --> 01:47:21,841
But when the time came...

1016
01:47:22,478 --> 01:47:25,098
when Gondor's need was dire...

1017
01:47:25,271 --> 01:47:27,145
they fled...

1018
01:47:27,315 --> 01:47:30,685
vanishing into the darkness of the mountain.

1019
01:47:31,736 --> 01:47:34,061
And so Isildur cursed them...

1020
01:47:35,615 --> 01:47:39,482
never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge.

1021
01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:46,956
Who shall call them from the grey twilight?

1022
01:47:47,418 --> 01:47:49,660
The forgotten people.

1023
01:47:49,837 --> 01:47:52,328
The heir of him to whom the oath they swore.

1024
01:47:52,799 --> 01:47:54,672
From the north shall he come.

1025
01:47:55,176 --> 01:47:56,835
Need shall drive him.

1026
01:47:57,929 --> 01:48:01,427
He shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead.

1027
01:48:19,908 --> 01:48:23,194
The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.

1028
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:30,707
The way is shut.

1029
01:48:31,461 --> 01:48:33,418
It was made by those who are dead.

1030
01:48:34,046 --> 01:48:36,288
And the Dead keep it.

1031
01:48:36,841 --> 01:48:38,383
The way is shut.

1032
01:48:49,729 --> 01:48:51,223
Brego!

1033
01:48:54,734 --> 01:48:57,438
I do not fear death.

1034
01:49:09,748 --> 01:49:12,156
Well, this is a thing unheard-of.

1035
01:49:12,334 --> 01:49:16,996
An Elf will go underground where a Dwarf dare not?

1036
01:49:17,172 --> 01:49:18,500
Oh.

1037
01:49:18,673 --> 01:49:21,508
Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.

1038
01:49:36,524 --> 01:49:38,766
We must ride light and swift.

1039
01:49:38,943 --> 01:49:40,686
It is a long road ahead.

1040
01:49:40,861 --> 01:49:43,946
And man and beast must reach the
end with the strength to fight.

1041
01:49:49,453 --> 01:49:52,454
Little Hobbits do not belong in war, Master Meriadoc.

1042
01:49:52,789 --> 01:49:54,782
All my friends have gone to battle.

1043
01:49:54,958 --> 01:49:56,832
I would be ashamed to be left behind.

1044
01:49:57,002 --> 01:49:59,125
It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.

1045
01:49:59,296 --> 01:50:01,668
And none of my riders can bear you as a burden.

1046
01:50:02,674 --> 01:50:04,797
I want to fight.

1047
01:50:05,302 --> 01:50:07,294
I will say no more.

1048
01:50:24,112 --> 01:50:26,069
Ride with me.

1049
01:50:27,532 --> 01:50:28,942
My lady.

1050
01:50:29,116 --> 01:50:31,488
Form up! Move out!

1051
01:50:31,661 --> 01:50:34,864
Form up! Move out!

1052
01:50:37,958 --> 01:50:39,156
Ride!

1053
01:50:39,335 --> 01:50:42,289
Ride now to Gondor!

1054
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:25,663
What is it?

1055
01:51:25,838 --> 01:51:27,380
What do you see?

1056
01:51:27,631 --> 01:51:29,754
I see shapes of men.

1057
01:51:32,428 --> 01:51:33,803
And of horses.

1058
01:51:34,555 --> 01:51:35,753
Where?

1059
01:51:35,931 --> 01:51:38,885
Pale banners like shreds of cloud.

1060
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:43,517
Spears rise...

1061
01:51:44,147 --> 01:51:47,599
like winter-thickets through a shroud of mist.

1062
01:51:48,860 --> 01:51:51,018
The Dead are following.

1063
01:51:52,239 --> 01:51:53,733
They have been summoned.

1064
01:51:54,408 --> 01:51:56,234
The Dead?

1065
01:51:56,618 --> 01:51:58,326
Summoned?

1066
01:51:58,745 --> 01:52:00,619
I knew that.

1067
01:52:03,958 --> 01:52:05,702
Very good.

1068
01:52:06,419 --> 01:52:08,495
Very good! Legolas!

1069
01:52:46,458 --> 01:52:47,868
Do not look down.

1070
01:53:40,469 --> 01:53:45,594
Who enters my domain?

1071
01:53:49,353 --> 01:53:51,558
One who will have your allegiance.

1072
01:53:54,523 --> 01:53:59,862
The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.

1073
01:54:00,196 --> 01:54:02,865
You will suffer me.

1074
01:54:26,387 --> 01:54:29,757
The way is shut.

1075
01:54:30,934 --> 01:54:35,394
It was made by those who are dead.

1076
01:54:35,772 --> 01:54:39,935
And the Dead keep it.

1077
01:54:49,076 --> 01:54:52,161
The way is shut.

1078
01:54:53,915 --> 01:54:56,536
Now you must die.

1079
01:55:00,421 --> 01:55:03,256
I summon you to fulfill your oath.

1080
01:55:03,591 --> 01:55:08,548
None but the king of Gondor may command me.

1081
01:55:14,143 --> 01:55:16,300
That line was broken.

1082
01:55:18,939 --> 01:55:21,145
It has been remade.

1083
01:55:29,073 --> 01:55:30,616
Fight for us...

1084
01:55:30,784 --> 01:55:33,322
and regain your honor.

1085
01:55:37,498 --> 01:55:38,827
What say you?

1086
01:55:51,053 --> 01:55:52,595
What say you?

1087
01:55:53,347 --> 01:55:55,139
You waste your time, Aragorn.

1088
01:55:55,308 --> 01:55:58,474
They had no honor in life, they have none now in death.

1089
01:55:58,978 --> 01:56:01,469
I am Isildur's heir.

1090
01:56:02,023 --> 01:56:03,979
Fight for me...

1091
01:56:04,566 --> 01:56:08,149
and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.

1092
01:56:12,074 --> 01:56:14,031
What say you?

1093
01:56:21,958 --> 01:56:24,165
You have my word!

1094
01:56:24,460 --> 01:56:28,459
Fight, and I will release you from this living death!

1095
01:56:29,925 --> 01:56:31,419
What say you?!

1096
01:56:34,721 --> 01:56:37,675
Stand, you traitors!

1097
01:57:04,624 --> 01:57:05,656
Out!

1098
01:57:27,021 --> 01:57:28,599
Legolas!

1099
01:57:29,733 --> 01:57:30,930
Run!

1100
01:58:37,256 --> 01:58:39,331
We fight.

1101
01:58:49,685 --> 01:58:52,258
Open the gate! Quick!

1102
01:59:23,301 --> 01:59:25,293
Quick! Hurry!

1103
01:59:39,065 --> 01:59:40,690
Faramir!

1104
01:59:41,694 --> 01:59:44,943
Say not that he has fallen.

1105
01:59:46,115 --> 01:59:47,657
They were outnumbered.

1106
01:59:48,074 --> 01:59:49,652
None survived.

1107
01:59:50,368 --> 01:59:52,361
Fear.

1108
01:59:52,913 --> 01:59:56,116
The city is rank with it.

1109
01:59:58,460 --> 02:00:00,915
Let us ease their pain.

1110
02:00:01,171 --> 02:00:02,914
Release the prisoners.

1111
02:00:03,089 --> 02:00:05,047
Catapults!

1112
02:00:18,395 --> 02:00:21,847
My sons are spent.

1113
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:25,817
My line has ended.

1114
02:00:28,656 --> 02:00:30,067
He's alive!

1115
02:00:30,240 --> 02:00:33,407
The House of Stewards has failed.

1116
02:00:33,577 --> 02:00:35,035
He needs medicine, my lord.

1117
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:38,748
My line has ended!

1118
02:00:40,250 --> 02:00:42,243
My lord!

1119
02:00:55,766 --> 02:00:57,592
Rohan...

1120
02:00:58,351 --> 02:01:00,758
has deserted us.

1121
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:18,403
Theoden's betrayed me.

1122
02:01:29,548 --> 02:01:31,375
Abandon your posts!

1123
02:01:32,426 --> 02:01:36,340
Flee! Flee for your lives!

1124
02:01:46,481 --> 02:01:48,023
Prepare for battle!

1125
02:01:48,566 --> 02:01:51,732
Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!

1126
02:01:52,904 --> 02:01:54,861
Over here!

1127
02:01:55,615 --> 02:01:57,987
Return to your posts!

1128
02:02:08,794 --> 02:02:11,415
Send these foul beasts into the abyss.

1129
02:02:21,598 --> 02:02:23,057
Stay where you are.

1130
02:02:40,032 --> 02:02:41,443
We need more rubble!

1131
02:02:41,617 --> 02:02:43,491
Watch out!

1132
02:02:43,661 --> 02:02:46,199
Down to the lower levels. Quick!

1133
02:02:48,082 --> 02:02:49,624
Double up, men!

1134
02:03:58,609 --> 02:04:01,610
Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.

1135
02:04:02,113 --> 02:04:05,611
Stand to your posts! Fight!

1136
02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:47,904
Not at the towers!

1137
02:04:48,073 --> 02:04:51,074
Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!

1138
02:04:51,827 --> 02:04:53,654
Bring them down!

1139
02:05:28,779 --> 02:05:30,819
Fight them back!

1140
02:05:30,990 --> 02:05:32,983
Peregrin Took!

1141
02:05:33,868 --> 02:05:37,034
- Go back to the Citadel!
- They'd called us out to fight.

1142
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:55,092
This is no place for a Hobbit.

1143
02:06:20,830 --> 02:06:22,289
Guard of the Citadel, indeed.

1144
02:06:22,916 --> 02:06:26,249
Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!

1145
02:06:37,596 --> 02:06:40,550
What are you doing, you useless scum?!

1146
02:06:40,724 --> 02:06:42,682
The door won't give. It's too strong.

1147
02:06:49,024 --> 02:06:51,431
Get back there and smash it down.

1148
02:06:51,609 --> 02:06:53,602
But nothing can breach it.

1149
02:06:56,531 --> 02:06:58,773
Grond will breach it.

1150
02:07:02,203 --> 02:07:04,279
Bring up the wolf's head.

1151
02:07:07,458 --> 02:07:12,797
Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!

1152
02:07:13,131 --> 02:07:16,963
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1153
02:07:18,886 --> 02:07:22,302
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1154
02:07:23,015 --> 02:07:26,680
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1155
02:07:27,102 --> 02:07:31,266
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1156
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:35,141
Grond! Grond! Grond!

1157
02:07:50,100 --> 02:07:51,873
You may go no further.

1158
02:07:54,513 --> 02:07:57,016
You will not enter Gondor.

1159
02:07:57,641 --> 02:08:00,061
Who are you to deny us passage?

1160
02:08:00,144 --> 02:08:04,106
Legolas, fire a warning shot past the bosun's ear.

1161
02:08:05,879 --> 02:08:07,443
Mind your aim.

1162
02:08:14,178 --> 02:08:16,723
That's it. Right. We warned you.

1163
02:08:16,931 --> 02:08:18,912
Prepare to be boarded.

1164
02:08:20,685 --> 02:08:21,821
Boarded?

1165
02:08:21,832 --> 02:08:23,813
By you and whose army?

1166
02:08:25,273 --> 02:08:27,045
This army.

1167
02:08:44,250 --> 02:08:45,709
In there.

1168
02:08:47,795 --> 02:08:49,515
What is this place?

1169
02:08:54,051 --> 02:08:57,335
Master must go inside the tunnel.

1170
02:08:59,004 --> 02:09:02,497
Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.

1171
02:09:05,155 --> 02:09:06,876
It's the only way.

1172
02:09:09,483 --> 02:09:11,255
Go in...

1173
02:09:11,735 --> 02:09:13,941
or go back.

1174
02:09:16,781 --> 02:09:19,402
I can't go back.

1175
02:09:32,213 --> 02:09:34,757
- What's that smell?
- Orcses' filth.

1176
02:09:34,768 --> 02:09:37,715
Orcses come in here sometimes.

1177
02:09:43,318 --> 02:09:44,569
Hurry.

1178
02:09:49,834 --> 02:09:51,398
This way.

1179
02:09:54,422 --> 02:09:56,038
Smeagol?

1180
02:09:57,185 --> 02:09:59,166
Over here.

1181
02:10:08,290 --> 02:10:10,636
It's sticky. What is it?

1182
02:10:11,418 --> 02:10:13,138
You will see.

1183
02:10:13,712 --> 02:10:15,589
Oh, yes.

1184
02:10:16,058 --> 02:10:18,922
You will see.

1185
02:10:28,205 --> 02:10:29,769
Smeagol?

1186
02:10:31,542 --> 02:10:32,567
Smeagol!

1187
02:10:35,191 --> 02:10:36,860
Smeagol!

1188
02:10:46,452 --> 02:10:47,909
Sam.

1189
02:12:28,375 --> 02:12:30,690
And you, Frodo Baggins...

1190
02:12:30,700 --> 02:12:35,636
I give you the light of
Earendil, our most beloved star.

1191
02:12:36,873 --> 02:12:40,095
May it be a light for you in dark places...

1192
02:12:40,136 --> 02:12:43,728
when all other lights go out.

1193
02:12:43,754 --> 02:12:47,612
Aiya Earendil Elenion Ancalima!
(Hail Earendil brightest of the Stars!)

1194
02:14:00,235 --> 02:14:03,052
Naughty little fly.

1195
02:14:03,676 --> 02:14:07,013
Why does he cry?

1196
02:14:07,430 --> 02:14:10,610
Caught in a web

1197
02:14:11,027 --> 02:14:13,237
Soon you'll be...

1198
02:14:13,613 --> 02:14:15,440
Eaten.

1199
02:14:53,569 --> 02:14:55,487
Got away, did it, precious?

1200
02:14:55,915 --> 02:14:57,687
Not this time.

1201
02:14:57,896 --> 02:15:00,865
- Not this time!
- No!

1202
02:15:08,166 --> 02:15:11,041
It wasn't us. It wasn't us!

1203
02:15:11,972 --> 02:15:14,527
Smeagol wouldn't hurt master.

1204
02:15:14,683 --> 02:15:16,206
We promised.

1205
02:15:16,664 --> 02:15:19,114
You must believe us.

1206
02:15:19,219 --> 02:15:20,760
It was the precious.

1207
02:15:21,565 --> 02:15:25,721
The precious made us do it.

1208
02:15:43,148 --> 02:15:45,743
I have to destroy it, Smeagol.

1209
02:15:55,191 --> 02:15:58,087
I have to destroy it for both our sakes.

1210
02:16:08,538 --> 02:16:09,595
No!

1211
02:16:33,145 --> 02:16:35,240
I'm so sorry, Sam.

1212
02:16:40,131 --> 02:16:42,287
I'm so sorry.

1213
02:17:08,596 --> 02:17:12,861
This task was appointed to you, Frodo of the Shire.

1214
02:17:14,383 --> 02:17:16,521
If you do not find a way...

1215
02:17:18,033 --> 02:17:19,649
no one will.

1216
02:17:53,380 --> 02:17:55,495
The scouts report Minas Tirith is surrounded.

1217
02:17:55,986 --> 02:17:57,952
The lower level's in flames.

1218
02:17:58,697 --> 02:18:00,871
Everywhere, legions of the enemy advance.

1219
02:18:01,669 --> 02:18:02,868
Time is against us.

1220
02:18:02,920 --> 02:18:04,165
Make ready!

1221
02:18:04,432 --> 02:18:06,165
Take heart, Merry.

1222
02:18:06,518 --> 02:18:08,551
It will soon be over.

1223
02:18:09,614 --> 02:18:10,845
My lady...

1224
02:18:11,595 --> 02:18:13,973
you are fair and brave...

1225
02:18:14,494 --> 02:18:16,736
and have much to live for...

1226
02:18:18,352 --> 02:18:20,384
and many who love you.

1227
02:18:23,566 --> 02:18:25,900
I know it is too late to turn aside.

1228
02:18:27,059 --> 02:18:29,646
I know there is not much point now in hoping.

1229
02:18:31,021 --> 02:18:34,618
If I were a knight of Rohan, capable of great deeds...

1230
02:18:34,619 --> 02:18:37,571
But
- I'm not.

1231
02:18:38,007 --> 02:18:39,581
I'm a Hobbit.

1232
02:18:42,730 --> 02:18:44,795
And I know I can't save Middle-earth.

1233
02:18:48,590 --> 02:18:50,498
I just want to help my friends.

1234
02:18:52,917 --> 02:18:54,088
Frodo.

1235
02:18:55,420 --> 02:18:56,679
Sam.

1236
02:18:58,756 --> 02:19:00,306
Pippin.

1237
02:19:02,093 --> 02:19:05,325
More than anything, I wish I could see them again.

1238
02:19:09,287 --> 02:19:11,352
Prepare to move out!

1239
02:19:11,727 --> 02:19:14,970
Make haste. We ride through the night.

1240
02:19:31,392 --> 02:19:32,383
To battle.

1241
02:19:33,060 --> 02:19:34,364
To battle.

1242
02:19:57,668 --> 02:19:59,032
Back to the gate!

1243
02:19:59,753 --> 02:20:01,484
Hurry!

1244
02:20:21,650 --> 02:20:25,885
I am steward of the House of Anarion.

1245
02:20:26,342 --> 02:20:28,531
Thus have I walked.

1246
02:20:29,991 --> 02:20:32,911
And thus now will I sleep.

1247
02:20:39,115 --> 02:20:40,904
Gondor is lost.

1248
02:20:41,617 --> 02:20:44,818
There is no hope for Men.

1249
02:20:59,968 --> 02:21:02,261
Why do the fools fly?

1250
02:21:04,191 --> 02:21:06,890
Better to die sooner than late.

1251
02:21:09,352 --> 02:21:11,095
For die we must.

1252
02:21:23,742 --> 02:21:27,078
No tomb for Denethor and Faramir.

1253
02:21:27,912 --> 02:21:33,439
No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.

1254
02:21:34,116 --> 02:21:38,745
We shall burn, like the heathen kings of old.

1255
02:21:42,875 --> 02:21:44,253
Bring wood and oil.

1256
02:21:47,515 --> 02:21:48,425
Steady.

1257
02:21:49,131 --> 02:21:50,639
Steady.

1258
02:22:05,501 --> 02:22:07,795
You are soldiers of Gondor.

1259
02:22:08,316 --> 02:22:12,643
No matter what comes through that
gate, you will stand your ground.

1260
02:22:18,920 --> 02:22:19,921
Run!

1261
02:22:22,340 --> 02:22:23,644
Volley!

1262
02:22:24,551 --> 02:22:25,966
Fire!

1263
02:24:19,643 --> 02:24:21,363
Let him go, you filth.

1264
02:24:23,417 --> 02:24:24,804
Let him go!

1265
02:24:26,420 --> 02:24:28,505
You will not touch him again.

1266
02:24:31,790 --> 02:24:33,250
Come on and finish it.

1267
02:26:23,409 --> 02:26:24,533
Back!

1268
02:26:35,765 --> 02:26:36,912
Mr. Frodo.

1269
02:26:46,713 --> 02:26:48,174
Oh, no.

1270
02:26:48,799 --> 02:26:50,307
Frodo.

1271
02:26:50,936 --> 02:26:52,476
Mr. Frodo.

1272
02:26:57,422 --> 02:26:58,548
Wake up.

1273
02:27:02,666 --> 02:27:04,804
Don't leave me here alone.

1274
02:27:06,629 --> 02:27:08,766
Don't go where I can't follow.

1275
02:27:13,198 --> 02:27:14,345
Wake up.

1276
02:27:21,278 --> 02:27:23,207
Not asleep.

1277
02:27:25,553 --> 02:27:27,274
Dead.

1278
02:27:46,199 --> 02:27:48,075
You get back, you scum!

1279
02:27:57,512 --> 02:27:59,076
What's this?

1280
02:27:59,931 --> 02:28:02,829
Looks like old Shelob's been having a bit of fun.

1281
02:28:04,654 --> 02:28:07,000
Killed another one, has she?

1282
02:28:07,313 --> 02:28:09,138
No.

1283
02:28:12,057 --> 02:28:14,158
This fellow ain't dead.

1284
02:28:14,163 --> 02:28:16,332
Not dead?

1285
02:28:16,853 --> 02:28:22,275
- She jabs him with her stinger,
and he goes as limp as a boned fish.

1286
02:28:22,953 --> 02:28:25,560
Then she has her way with them.

1287
02:28:26,133 --> 02:28:28,167
That's how she likes to feed.

1288
02:28:28,323 --> 02:28:30,252
Fresh blood.

1289
02:28:30,461 --> 02:28:32,650
Get him to the tower!

1290
02:28:36,352 --> 02:28:38,103
Samwise, you fool.

1291
02:28:38,145 --> 02:28:40,992
This scum will be awake in a couple of hours.

1292
02:28:41,304 --> 02:28:43,546
Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

1293
02:29:08,049 --> 02:29:11,073
The house of his spirit crumbles.

1294
02:29:12,429 --> 02:29:13,680
He is burning.

1295
02:29:14,983 --> 02:29:16,339
Already burning.

1296
02:29:16,704 --> 02:29:18,268
He's not dead.

1297
02:29:19,050 --> 02:29:20,614
He's not dead!

1298
02:29:22,699 --> 02:29:24,376
No! No!

1299
02:29:24,889 --> 02:29:26,870
No! No!

1300
02:29:27,339 --> 02:29:29,320
He's not dead!

1301
02:29:29,841 --> 02:29:33,126
- Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.
- No! No! No!

1302
02:29:33,334 --> 02:29:36,463
I release you from my service.

1303
02:29:37,818 --> 02:29:42,145
Go now and die in what way seems best to you.

1304
02:29:44,502 --> 02:29:46,556
Pour oil on the wood!

1305
02:29:48,453 --> 02:29:50,316
Come on, soldier! Move it!

1306
02:29:51,060 --> 02:29:53,738
- Hurry along there! Hurry along!
- Gandalf!

1307
02:29:54,397 --> 02:29:55,648
Where is Gandalf?

1308
02:29:57,108 --> 02:29:58,150
Gandalf!

1309
02:30:03,937 --> 02:30:04,980
Retreat!

1310
02:30:07,170 --> 02:30:08,890
The city is breached!

1311
02:30:09,046 --> 02:30:11,966
Fall back! To the second level!

1312
02:30:15,824 --> 02:30:17,596
Get the women and children out!

1313
02:30:17,701 --> 02:30:19,369
Get them out!

1314
02:30:19,640 --> 02:30:20,985
Retreat!

1315
02:30:21,089 --> 02:30:23,071
Come on. Come on, move.

1316
02:30:23,279 --> 02:30:27,606
Move into the city. Kill all in your path.

1317
02:30:35,687 --> 02:30:37,929
Take them down!

1318
02:30:58,730 --> 02:31:01,546
Fight! Fight to the last man!

1319
02:31:01,702 --> 02:31:03,214
Fight for your lives!

1320
02:31:03,624 --> 02:31:04,557
Gandalf!

1321
02:31:08,813 --> 02:31:09,991
Gandalf!

1322
02:31:10,096 --> 02:31:12,755
Denethor has lost his mind!

1323
02:31:12,963 --> 02:31:15,153
He's burning Faramir alive!

1324
02:31:15,194 --> 02:31:17,134
Up! Quickly!

1325
02:31:24,224 --> 02:31:25,423
Go back to the abyss.

1326
02:31:27,248 --> 02:31:30,584
Fall into the nothingness that
awaits you and your master.

1327
02:31:30,937 --> 02:31:37,258
Do you not know death when you see it, old man?

1328
02:31:37,466 --> 02:31:41,502
This is my hour.

1329
02:31:51,751 --> 02:31:52,741
Gandalf!

1330
02:32:01,990 --> 02:32:05,202
You have failed.

1331
02:32:06,265 --> 02:32:11,145
The world of Men will fall.

1332
02:33:08,336 --> 02:33:09,430
Courage, Merry.

1333
02:33:10,004 --> 02:33:12,090
Courage for our friends.

1334
02:33:15,917 --> 02:33:19,045
Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!

1335
02:33:19,076 --> 02:33:22,256
Pikes in front. Archers behind.

1336
02:33:30,493 --> 02:33:33,673
Eomer, take your Eored down the left flank.

1337
02:33:33,913 --> 02:33:34,977
Flank ready.

1338
02:33:35,446 --> 02:33:37,896
Gamling, follow the king's banner down the center.

1339
02:33:38,053 --> 02:33:41,859
Grimbold, take your company
right after you pass the wall.

1340
02:33:42,171 --> 02:33:44,570
Forth, and fear no darkness!

1341
02:33:44,987 --> 02:33:48,636
Arise, arise, Riders of Theoden!

1342
02:33:49,011 --> 02:33:54,162
Spears shall be shaken...
Shields shall be splintered...

1343
02:33:54,475 --> 02:33:57,968
a sword-day, a red day...

1344
02:33:58,291 --> 02:34:01,645
and the sun rises!

1345
02:34:09,698 --> 02:34:14,182
Whatever happens, stay with me. I'll look after you.

1346
02:34:20,386 --> 02:34:22,419
Ride now!

1347
02:34:23,931 --> 02:34:25,793
Ride now!

1348
02:34:26,642 --> 02:34:29,457
Ride! Ride for ruin...

1349
02:34:29,666 --> 02:34:32,846
and the world's ending!

1350
02:34:34,253 --> 02:34:38,164
- Death!
- Death!

1351
02:34:39,258 --> 02:34:42,334
- Death!
- Death!

1352
02:34:43,106 --> 02:34:44,941
- Death!
- Death!

1353
02:34:45,358 --> 02:34:49,633
- Death!
- Death!

1354
02:34:53,752 --> 02:34:56,254
For Eorlingas!

1355
02:35:39,369 --> 02:35:40,673
Fire!

1356
02:35:44,895 --> 02:35:46,720
Death!

1357
02:35:50,265 --> 02:35:51,986
Charge!

1358
02:35:52,038 --> 02:35:53,125
Fire at will!

1359
02:36:51,106 --> 02:36:53,973
Set a fire in our flesh.

1360
02:37:11,876 --> 02:37:13,524
Stay this madness!

1361
02:37:17,945 --> 02:37:22,282
You may triumph in the field of battle for a day...

1362
02:37:22,918 --> 02:37:26,453
but against the power that has risen in the east...

1363
02:37:26,818 --> 02:37:29,685
there is no victory.

1364
02:37:59,245 --> 02:38:00,914
No!

1365
02:38:00,976 --> 02:38:03,833
You will not take my son from me!

1366
02:38:03,864 --> 02:38:05,971
No!

1367
02:38:17,180 --> 02:38:18,587
Faramir.

1368
02:38:32,403 --> 02:38:36,104
So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.

1369
02:39:04,048 --> 02:39:06,134
Drive them to the river!

1370
02:39:08,480 --> 02:39:10,774
Make safe the city!

1371
02:39:50,552 --> 02:39:52,272
Re-form the line!

1372
02:39:53,472 --> 02:39:55,348
Re-form the line!

1373
02:40:02,543 --> 02:40:05,306
Sound the charge! Take them head-on!

1374
02:40:05,775 --> 02:40:07,965
Charge!

1375
02:41:26,792 --> 02:41:28,043
Cut him down!

1376
02:41:55,049 --> 02:41:57,499
Take the reins. Pull him left!

1377
02:41:59,897 --> 02:42:00,992
Left!

1378
02:42:18,770 --> 02:42:20,230
Aim for their heads!

1379
02:42:26,277 --> 02:42:29,614
Bring it down! Bring it down! Bring it down!

1380
02:42:35,296 --> 02:42:36,235
Merry!

1381
02:42:43,481 --> 02:42:44,889
Merry!

1382
02:43:58,346 --> 02:44:00,275
I didn't think it would end this way.

1383
02:44:01,631 --> 02:44:03,090
End?

1384
02:44:04,467 --> 02:44:06,688
No, the journey doesn't end here.

1385
02:44:08,971 --> 02:44:11,901
Death is just another path...

1386
02:44:12,767 --> 02:44:14,769
one that we all must take.

1387
02:44:15,738 --> 02:44:19,304
The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back...

1388
02:44:19,408 --> 02:44:22,849
and all turns to silver glass.

1389
02:44:25,143 --> 02:44:26,916
And then you see it.

1390
02:44:29,034 --> 02:44:31,547
What, Gandalf?

1391
02:44:32,715 --> 02:44:34,154
See what?

1392
02:44:35,275 --> 02:44:37,282
White shores...

1393
02:44:39,159 --> 02:44:41,401
and beyond.

1394
02:44:42,965 --> 02:44:44,841
A far green country...

1395
02:44:45,603 --> 02:44:48,334
under a swift sunrise.

1396
02:44:52,505 --> 02:44:54,226
Well...

1397
02:44:54,278 --> 02:44:55,842
that isn't so bad.

1398
02:44:55,863 --> 02:44:57,145
No.

1399
02:44:59,491 --> 02:45:01,107
No, it isn't.

1400
02:45:17,425 --> 02:45:20,814
Rally to me! To me!

1401
02:45:41,772 --> 02:45:46,151
Feast on his flesh.

1402
02:45:50,583 --> 02:45:52,720
I will kill you if you touch him.

1403
02:45:52,731 --> 02:45:58,247
Do not come between the Nazgul and his prey.

1404
02:47:07,220 --> 02:47:10,609
Late as usual, pirate scum!

1405
02:47:10,843 --> 02:47:12,642
There's knife-work here needs doing.

1406
02:47:12,694 --> 02:47:16,513
Come on, you sea rats! Get off your ships!

1407
02:47:31,645 --> 02:47:34,021
There's plenty for the both of us.

1408
02:47:34,121 --> 02:47:36,467
May the best Dwarf win.

1409
02:47:53,828 --> 02:47:56,055
You fool.

1410
02:47:56,226 --> 02:47:59,642
No man can kill me.

1411
02:48:02,013 --> 02:48:05,190
Die now.

1412
02:48:15,829 --> 02:48:17,863
I am no man.

1413
02:48:34,389 --> 02:48:37,888
- 15! 16!
- 17!

1414
02:48:45,691 --> 02:48:47,601
Merry!

1415
02:49:29,609 --> 02:49:31,401
Legolas!

1416
02:49:53,800 --> 02:49:56,172
33, 34.

1417
02:50:43,265 --> 02:50:45,637
That still only counts as one!

1418
02:50:45,767 --> 02:50:47,967
Come on, then. Come on!

1419
02:51:31,687 --> 02:51:34,522
I know your face...

1420
02:51:36,306 --> 02:51:38,227
Eowyn.

1421
02:51:40,821 --> 02:51:43,193
My eyes darken.

1422
02:51:44,283 --> 02:51:45,721
No.

1423
02:51:46,535 --> 02:51:48,224
No.

1424
02:51:50,231 --> 02:51:52,738
I am going to save you.

1425
02:51:54,063 --> 02:51:56,409
You already did.

1426
02:52:00,090 --> 02:52:01,714
Eowyn...

1427
02:52:03,166 --> 02:52:05,709
my body is broken.

1428
02:52:10,720 --> 02:52:13,222
You have to let me go.

1429
02:52:19,087 --> 02:52:21,682
I go to my fathers...

1430
02:52:23,133 --> 02:52:25,989
in whose mighty company...

1431
02:52:26,407 --> 02:52:29,782
I shall not now feel ashamed.

1432
02:52:46,354 --> 02:52:48,009
Eowyn.

1433
02:53:34,474 --> 02:53:36,971
Release us.

1434
02:53:38,827 --> 02:53:40,602
Bad idea.

1435
02:53:40,756 --> 02:53:44,483
Very handy in a tight spot, these
lads, despite the fact they're dead.

1436
02:53:44,509 --> 02:53:46,768
You gave us your word.

1437
02:53:48,445 --> 02:53:50,635
I hold your oath fulfilled.

1438
02:53:51,860 --> 02:53:53,319
Go.

1439
02:53:54,024 --> 02:53:55,861
Be at peace.

1440
02:54:39,162 --> 02:54:41,101
Merry.

1441
02:54:41,675 --> 02:54:45,011
No!

1442
02:54:48,556 --> 02:54:51,319
No!

1443
02:55:14,968 --> 02:55:18,898
With a sigh.

1444
02:55:19,013 --> 02:55:22,776
You turn away.

1445
02:55:22,913 --> 02:55:26,948
With a deepening heart.

1446
02:55:26,979 --> 02:55:31,880
No more words to say.

1447
02:55:32,005 --> 02:55:35,529
You will find.

1448
02:55:35,581 --> 02:55:44,079
That the world has changed forever.

1449
02:56:08,770 --> 02:56:16,580
And the trees are now turning from green to gold.

1450
02:56:20,448 --> 02:56:25,265
And the sun is now fading.

1451
02:56:25,370 --> 02:56:35,442
I wish I could hold you closer.

1452
02:56:38,273 --> 02:56:39,550
Merry!

1453
02:56:41,093 --> 02:56:43,200
Merry!

1454
02:56:54,544 --> 02:56:56,371
Merry.

1455
02:56:58,840 --> 02:57:00,085
Merry, it's me.

1456
02:57:02,698 --> 02:57:04,261
It's Pippin.

1457
02:57:06,764 --> 02:57:09,053
I knew you'd find me.

1458
02:57:09,225 --> 02:57:10,423
Yes.

1459
02:57:12,854 --> 02:57:14,930
Are you going to leave me?

1460
02:57:15,481 --> 02:57:17,189
No, Merry.

1461
02:57:18,484 --> 02:57:20,726
I'm going to look after you.

1462
02:58:04,425 --> 02:58:06,148
Hands off!

1463
02:58:06,302 --> 02:58:09,489
That shiny shirt, that's mine.

1464
02:58:09,742 --> 02:58:13,906
It's going to the Great Eye,
along with everything else.

1465
02:58:15,425 --> 02:58:19,335
I don't take orders from stinking Morgul-rats!

1466
02:58:20,117 --> 02:58:25,278
You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in your gut.

1467
02:58:45,767 --> 02:58:47,696
The scum tried to knife me.

1468
02:58:47,748 --> 02:58:49,690
Kill him!

1469
03:00:32,851 --> 03:00:34,917
That's for Frodo!

1470
03:00:35,197 --> 03:00:37,424
And for the Shire!

1471
03:00:40,828 --> 03:00:43,138
And that's for my old Gaffer!

1472
03:01:12,577 --> 03:01:15,963
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.

1473
03:01:17,061 --> 03:01:21,801
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.

1474
03:01:29,052 --> 03:01:30,806
Not if I stick you first.

1475
03:01:30,929 --> 03:01:32,493
Sam!

1476
03:01:37,550 --> 03:01:39,635
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

1477
03:01:39,687 --> 03:01:41,820
Sorry for everything.

1478
03:01:42,033 --> 03:01:45,990
- Let's get you out of here.
- It's too late. It's over.

1479
03:01:46,100 --> 03:01:49,033
They've taken it. Sam...

1480
03:01:49,801 --> 03:01:51,327
they took the Ring.

1481
03:01:52,043 --> 03:01:54,789
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

1482
03:02:06,745 --> 03:02:08,972
I thought I'd lost you.

1483
03:02:09,352 --> 03:02:11,059
So I took it.

1484
03:02:12,219 --> 03:02:14,305
Only for safekeeping.

1485
03:02:15,556 --> 03:02:17,309
Give it to me.

1486
03:02:20,821 --> 03:02:23,069
Give me the Ring, Sam.

1487
03:02:27,703 --> 03:02:28,989
Sam.

1488
03:02:30,570 --> 03:02:32,538
Give me the Ring.

1489
03:02:53,249 --> 03:02:54,550
You must understand.

1490
03:02:58,045 --> 03:02:59,893
The Ring is my burden.

1491
03:03:01,069 --> 03:03:03,227
It will destroy you, Sam.

1492
03:03:06,386 --> 03:03:08,364
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1493
03:03:09,671 --> 03:03:11,327
We best find you some clothes.

1494
03:03:11,496 --> 03:03:14,532
You can't go walking through
Mordor in naught but your skin.

1495
03:03:36,270 --> 03:03:38,476
We did it, Mr. Frodo.

1496
03:03:38,981 --> 03:03:41,269
We made it to Mordor.

1497
03:03:42,609 --> 03:03:44,269
There are so many of them.

1498
03:03:45,237 --> 03:03:47,810
We'll never get through unseen.

1499
03:03:52,942 --> 03:03:56,286
It's him, the Eye.

1500
03:04:04,005 --> 03:04:06,627
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.

1501
03:04:07,092 --> 03:04:09,131
There's nothing for it.

1502
03:04:12,138 --> 03:04:16,551
Come on. Let's just make it down the hill for starters.

1503
03:04:25,735 --> 03:04:29,152
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.

1504
03:04:30,427 --> 03:04:33,294
The darkness is deepening.

1505
03:04:33,346 --> 03:04:35,640
If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.

1506
03:04:35,651 --> 03:04:38,076
It's only a matter of time.

1507
03:04:39,550 --> 03:04:41,989
He has suffered a defeat, yes but...

1508
03:04:43,043 --> 03:04:47,527
behind the walls of Mordor, our enemy is regrouping.

1509
03:04:47,683 --> 03:04:49,456
Let him stay there.

1510
03:04:49,466 --> 03:04:52,344
Let him rot! Why should we care?

1511
03:04:52,407 --> 03:04:57,745
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

1512
03:05:04,418 --> 03:05:06,972
I've sent him to his death.

1513
03:05:08,485 --> 03:05:09,807
No.

1514
03:05:10,310 --> 03:05:12,728
There is still hope for Frodo.

1515
03:05:13,073 --> 03:05:17,201
He needs time and safe passage
across the plains of Gorgoroth.

1516
03:05:18,286 --> 03:05:20,859
- We can give him that.
- How?

1517
03:05:21,206 --> 03:05:23,910
Draw out Sauron's armies.

1518
03:05:24,073 --> 03:05:26,206
Empty his lands.

1519
03:05:26,419 --> 03:05:29,503
Then we gather our full strength
and march on the Black Gate.

1520
03:05:30,068 --> 03:05:33,132
We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.

1521
03:05:33,301 --> 03:05:34,878
Not for ourselves.

1522
03:05:35,073 --> 03:05:40,681
But we can give Frodo his chance if
we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.

1523
03:05:42,476 --> 03:05:46,260
Keep him blind to all else that moves.

1524
03:05:47,012 --> 03:05:48,221
A diversion.

1525
03:05:48,368 --> 03:05:50,190
Certainty of death...

1526
03:05:50,297 --> 03:05:53,111
small chance of success...

1527
03:05:53,946 --> 03:05:55,565
what are we waiting for?

1528
03:05:56,136 --> 03:05:58,564
Sauron will suspect a trap.

1529
03:05:59,368 --> 03:06:01,407
He will not take the bait.

1530
03:06:02,913 --> 03:06:05,404
Oh, I think he will.

1531
03:06:39,720 --> 03:06:42,431
Long have you hunted me.

1532
03:06:42,639 --> 03:06:44,620
Long have I eluded you.

1533
03:06:46,237 --> 03:06:48,033
No more.

1534
03:06:49,678 --> 03:06:52,158
Behold the Sword of Elendil.

1535
03:07:36,650 --> 03:07:39,162
The city has fallen silent.

1536
03:07:40,821 --> 03:07:43,878
There is no warmth left in the sun.

1537
03:07:44,679 --> 03:07:46,387
It grows so cold.

1538
03:07:49,371 --> 03:07:52,428
It's just the damp of the first spring rain.

1539
03:07:58,808 --> 03:08:02,021
I do not believe this darkness will endure.

1540
03:08:30,609 --> 03:08:32,225
Look, the Orcs...

1541
03:08:32,695 --> 03:08:34,760
they're moving off.

1542
03:08:35,812 --> 03:08:37,888
You see, Mr. Frodo...

1543
03:08:38,065 --> 03:08:40,390
some luck at last.

1544
03:08:40,567 --> 03:08:42,394
Move it, you slugs!

1545
03:08:43,643 --> 03:08:47,064
Come on! Faster!

1546
03:08:54,956 --> 03:08:58,188
Come along, you coldhearted wretched scum...

1547
03:08:58,199 --> 03:09:02,748
I'll whip you down to the bone, you...

1548
03:09:05,592 --> 03:09:07,260
Come on!

1549
03:09:07,427 --> 03:09:09,638
What have I told you?

1550
03:09:09,658 --> 03:09:11,952
No evation...

1551
03:09:12,942 --> 03:09:14,767
Now move it!

1552
03:09:16,592 --> 03:09:18,096
Get up!

1553
03:09:18,469 --> 03:09:21,148
Come on, you slugs!

1554
03:09:21,284 --> 03:09:24,933
You two are going straight to the front line!

1555
03:09:25,111 --> 03:09:30,407
Now, move it! Go on! Fall
in! Move it! Move it! Move it!

1556
03:09:42,972 --> 03:09:46,778
To the Gate, you slugs! Now, move it!

1557
03:09:56,214 --> 03:09:59,807
Don't you know we're at war?

1558
03:10:22,125 --> 03:10:24,995
Company, halt!

1559
03:10:28,798 --> 03:10:32,208
Inspection!

1560
03:10:32,343 --> 03:10:34,840
Sam, help me.

1561
03:10:35,002 --> 03:10:36,839
Mr. Frodo!

1562
03:10:39,537 --> 03:10:42,096
Stand up, Mr. Frodo. Stand up!

1563
03:10:42,248 --> 03:10:44,096
It's so heavy.

1564
03:10:53,197 --> 03:10:54,401
Oh, no.

1565
03:11:00,026 --> 03:11:02,029
What do I do? What do we do?

1566
03:11:05,083 --> 03:11:06,246
- Hit me.
- What?

1567
03:11:06,387 --> 03:11:08,457
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.

1568
03:11:08,628 --> 03:11:10,206
Get off of me!

1569
03:11:10,870 --> 03:11:13,206
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.

1570
03:11:21,818 --> 03:11:23,889
Get off of me!

1571
03:11:24,790 --> 03:11:26,720
Break it up! Break it up!

1572
03:11:29,274 --> 03:11:33,894
Oi! I'll have your guts if you
don't shut this rabble down!

1573
03:11:33,914 --> 03:11:36,353
Go, Sam. Now!

1574
03:11:45,279 --> 03:11:46,831
Move along, scum!

1575
03:11:46,999 --> 03:11:48,908
Back in the line!

1576
03:11:49,397 --> 03:11:51,210
You maggots!

1577
03:11:51,848 --> 03:11:54,880
Get back into the line, you slugs!

1578
03:11:57,218 --> 03:12:00,752
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.

1579
03:12:49,456 --> 03:12:51,600
I can't...

1580
03:12:51,750 --> 03:12:55,519
I can't... I can't manage the Ring, Sam.

1581
03:12:55,608 --> 03:12:56,848
It's... It's...

1582
03:12:57,016 --> 03:12:59,599
It's such a weight to carry.

1583
03:13:00,456 --> 03:13:01,519
It's...

1584
03:13:01,656 --> 03:13:03,654
Such a weight.

1585
03:13:08,589 --> 03:13:11,092
We're going that way. Straight as we can.

1586
03:13:12,447 --> 03:13:15,680
There's no point carrying
anything we're not sure to need.

1587
03:13:30,746 --> 03:13:32,677
Mr. Frodo.

1588
03:13:34,135 --> 03:13:35,681
Look.

1589
03:13:38,150 --> 03:13:40,101
There is light...

1590
03:13:40,443 --> 03:13:42,007
and beauty up there...

1591
03:13:42,268 --> 03:13:44,737
that no shadow can touch.

1592
03:14:35,758 --> 03:14:37,414
Take mine.

1593
03:14:37,895 --> 03:14:40,039
There's a few drops left.

1594
03:14:55,204 --> 03:14:57,840
There will be none left for the return journey.

1595
03:14:58,749 --> 03:15:01,937
I don't think there will be
a return journey, Mr. Frodo.

1596
03:15:54,793 --> 03:15:56,983
Frodo, get down!

1597
03:15:58,703 --> 03:16:00,654
Hide!

1598
03:16:10,799 --> 03:16:12,838
Frodo!

1599
03:16:18,619 --> 03:16:20,092
Where are they?

1600
03:16:56,155 --> 03:16:59,213
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!

1601
03:17:00,118 --> 03:17:02,974
Let justice be done upon him!

1602
03:17:46,413 --> 03:17:50,425
My master, Sauron the Great, bids thee welcome.

1603
03:17:56,266 --> 03:17:59,977
Is there any in this rout with
authority to treat with me?

1604
03:18:00,333 --> 03:18:03,484
We do not come to treat with Sauron...

1605
03:18:03,617 --> 03:18:06,172
faithless and accursed.

1606
03:18:06,182 --> 03:18:10,186
Tell your master this: The
armies of Mordor must disband.

1607
03:18:10,290 --> 03:18:13,106
He is to depart these lands, never to return.

1608
03:18:14,044 --> 03:18:16,624
Old Greybeard.

1609
03:18:17,954 --> 03:18:22,342
I have a token I was bidden to show thee.

1610
03:18:27,349 --> 03:18:28,677
Frodo.

1611
03:18:31,519 --> 03:18:32,978
Frodo.

1612
03:18:33,699 --> 03:18:35,178
- Silence.
- No!

1613
03:18:35,784 --> 03:18:37,352
Silence!

1614
03:18:39,121 --> 03:18:42,900
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.

1615
03:18:43,813 --> 03:18:47,987
Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host.

1616
03:18:53,353 --> 03:18:59,253
Who would've thought one so
small could endure so much pain?

1617
03:19:01,851 --> 03:19:04,005
And he did, Gandalf.

1618
03:19:04,145 --> 03:19:05,920
He did.

1619
03:19:12,852 --> 03:19:14,429
And who is this?

1620
03:19:14,520 --> 03:19:16,679
Isildur's heir?

1621
03:19:16,814 --> 03:19:19,856
It takes more to make a king
than a broken Elvish blade.

1622
03:19:24,582 --> 03:19:27,186
I guess that concludes negotiations.

1623
03:19:29,326 --> 03:19:30,524
I do not believe it.

1624
03:19:32,506 --> 03:19:33,913
I will not.

1625
03:19:49,971 --> 03:19:51,804
Pull back.

1626
03:19:52,056 --> 03:19:54,138
Pull back!

1627
03:20:06,341 --> 03:20:08,402
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

1628
03:20:10,303 --> 03:20:13,849
The light's passed on, away towards the north.

1629
03:20:13,953 --> 03:20:15,869
Something's drawn its gaze.

1630
03:20:33,347 --> 03:20:36,140
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.

1631
03:20:37,987 --> 03:20:42,224
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!

1632
03:20:45,025 --> 03:20:46,982
I see in your eyes...

1633
03:20:47,319 --> 03:20:51,405
the same fear that would take the heart of me.

1634
03:20:53,366 --> 03:20:57,120
A day may come when the courage of Men fails...

1635
03:20:57,141 --> 03:21:00,739
when we forsake our friends and
break all bonds of fellowship.

1636
03:21:00,769 --> 03:21:03,585
But it is not this day.

1637
03:21:03,845 --> 03:21:06,913
An hour of wolves and shattered shields...

1638
03:21:07,078 --> 03:21:09,959
when the age of Men comes crashing down.

1639
03:21:10,101 --> 03:21:12,588
But it is not this day.

1640
03:21:12,760 --> 03:21:14,420
This day we fight!

1641
03:21:16,514 --> 03:21:20,554
By all that you hold dear on this good earth...

1642
03:21:20,726 --> 03:21:24,973
I bid you stand, Men of the West!

1643
03:22:53,432 --> 03:22:56,977
Never thought I'd die fighting
side by side with an Elf.

1644
03:22:57,446 --> 03:22:59,771
What about side by side with a friend?

1645
03:23:03,285 --> 03:23:05,070
Aye.

1646
03:23:05,892 --> 03:23:07,704
I could do that.

1647
03:23:38,006 --> 03:23:40,103
Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo?

1648
03:23:43,063 --> 03:23:45,316
It'll be spring soon.

1649
03:23:46,087 --> 03:23:48,823
And the orchards will be in blossom.

1650
03:23:48,955 --> 03:23:52,661
And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket.

1651
03:23:54,012 --> 03:23:58,041
And they'll be sowing the summer
barley in the lower fields...

1652
03:23:59,069 --> 03:24:03,467
and eating the first of the strawberries with cream.

1653
03:24:05,377 --> 03:24:07,878
Do you remember the taste of strawberries?

1654
03:24:09,443 --> 03:24:11,183
No, Sam.

1655
03:24:11,320 --> 03:24:14,305
I can't recall the taste of food...

1656
03:24:15,439 --> 03:24:18,724
nor the sound of water...

1657
03:24:18,880 --> 03:24:22,483
nor the touch of grass.

1658
03:24:23,415 --> 03:24:24,989
I'm...

1659
03:24:25,866 --> 03:24:27,241
naked in the dark.

1660
03:24:28,889 --> 03:24:31,199
There's... there's nothing.

1661
03:24:31,340 --> 03:24:36,080
No veil between me and the wheel of fire.

1662
03:24:37,335 --> 03:24:39,244
I can see him...

1663
03:24:39,629 --> 03:24:41,331
with my waking eyes.

1664
03:24:42,340 --> 03:24:44,837
Then let us be rid of it...

1665
03:24:45,416 --> 03:24:47,668
once and for all.

1666
03:24:48,388 --> 03:24:50,464
Come on, Mr. Frodo.

1667
03:24:50,629 --> 03:24:53,261
I can't carry it for you...

1668
03:24:53,653 --> 03:24:55,724
but I can carry you.

1669
03:24:56,260 --> 03:24:58,014
Come on!

1670
03:25:28,427 --> 03:25:31,381
Aragorn.

1671
03:25:42,920 --> 03:25:46,674
Elessar.

1672
03:25:57,518 --> 03:25:59,946
For Frodo.

1673
03:26:34,898 --> 03:26:36,403
Look, Mr. Frodo.

1674
03:26:37,088 --> 03:26:39,325
A doorway.

1675
03:26:39,903 --> 03:26:41,573
We're almost there.

1676
03:26:43,917 --> 03:26:47,867
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

1677
03:27:01,799 --> 03:27:03,470
Mustn't go that way.

1678
03:27:04,979 --> 03:27:07,477
Mustn't hurt the precious.

1679
03:27:07,638 --> 03:27:09,392
You swore!

1680
03:27:09,567 --> 03:27:11,643
You swore on the precious!

1681
03:27:13,529 --> 03:27:15,487
Smeagol promised!

1682
03:27:16,397 --> 03:27:18,400
Smeagol lied.

1683
03:28:10,877 --> 03:28:12,793
Frodo!

1684
03:28:39,864 --> 03:28:41,649
Eagles.

1685
03:28:43,044 --> 03:28:44,569
The eagles are coming!

1686
03:29:07,391 --> 03:29:09,264
Frodo!

1687
03:29:14,481 --> 03:29:15,803
I'm here, Sam.

1688
03:29:23,240 --> 03:29:24,906
Destroy it!

1689
03:29:35,439 --> 03:29:38,745
Go on! Now!

1690
03:29:38,880 --> 03:29:41,459
Throw it in the fire!

1691
03:29:54,833 --> 03:29:57,523
What are you waiting for?

1692
03:29:59,369 --> 03:30:01,772
Just let it go!

1693
03:30:34,976 --> 03:30:37,218
The Ring is mine.

1694
03:30:40,763 --> 03:30:42,517
No.

1695
03:30:42,901 --> 03:30:44,223
No.

1696
03:30:52,650 --> 03:30:55,329
No!

1697
03:32:39,734 --> 03:32:41,639
Yes!

1698
03:32:42,810 --> 03:32:44,517
Yes!

1699
03:32:45,625 --> 03:32:48,516
Precious! Precious!

1700
03:32:48,649 --> 03:32:51,857
Precious! Precious!

1701
03:33:44,745 --> 03:33:46,614
Give me your hand!

1702
03:33:54,963 --> 03:33:57,371
Take my hand!

1703
03:34:00,020 --> 03:34:01,380
No!

1704
03:34:08,623 --> 03:34:10,600
Don't you let go.

1705
03:34:15,191 --> 03:34:16,769
Don't let go.

1706
03:34:18,372 --> 03:34:19,862
Reach!

1707
03:35:49,033 --> 03:35:51,904
Frodo!

1708
03:35:52,474 --> 03:35:55,496
Frodo!

1709
03:37:16,827 --> 03:37:18,696
It's gone.

1710
03:37:23,135 --> 03:37:24,910
It's done.

1711
03:37:25,377 --> 03:37:27,412
Yes, Mr. Frodo.

1712
03:37:28,766 --> 03:37:31,205
It's over now.

1713
03:37:56,866 --> 03:37:59,238
I can see the Shire.

1714
03:38:01,454 --> 03:38:03,779
The Brandywine River.

1715
03:38:05,886 --> 03:38:07,909
Bag End.

1716
03:38:10,213 --> 03:38:12,959
Gandalf's fireworks.

1717
03:38:13,341 --> 03:38:17,131
The lights in the Party Tree.

1718
03:38:18,606 --> 03:38:21,757
Rosie Cotton dancing.

1719
03:38:22,881 --> 03:38:25,596
She had ribbons in her hair.

1720
03:38:28,512 --> 03:38:31,476
If ever I was to marry someone...

1721
03:38:32,370 --> 03:38:34,643
it would've been her.

1722
03:38:36,071 --> 03:38:38,147
It would've been her.

1723
03:38:50,252 --> 03:38:53,502
I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee...

1724
03:38:57,759 --> 03:39:00,718
here at the end of all things.

1725
03:40:50,369 --> 03:40:52,450
Gandalf?

1726
03:41:12,057 --> 03:41:14,091
Frodo!

1727
03:41:33,849 --> 03:41:35,697
Gimli!

1728
03:43:18,639 --> 03:43:22,429
Now come the days of the king.

1729
03:43:27,398 --> 03:43:29,764
May they be blessed.

1730
03:43:50,024 --> 03:43:52,714
This day does not belong to one man...

1731
03:43:52,839 --> 03:43:54,755
but to all.

1732
03:43:56,384 --> 03:43:59,343
Let us together rebuild this world...

1733
03:43:59,512 --> 03:44:03,759
that we may share in the days of peace.

1734
03:44:15,882 --> 03:44:20,053
Et Earello...
(Out of the Great Sea...)

1735
03:44:20,314 --> 03:44:27,665
Endorenna utulien.
(to Middle-Earth I am come.)

1736
03:44:29,229 --> 03:44:33,087
Sinome maruvan...
(In this place will I abide...)

1737
03:44:33,921 --> 03:44:39,864
ar Hildinyar...
(and my heirs...)

1738
03:44:40,698 --> 03:44:49,770
tenn' Ambar-metta.
(unto the ending of the world.)

1739
03:44:58,215 --> 03:44:59,675
Hannon le.
(Thank you.)

1740
03:46:38,209 --> 03:46:40,327
My friends...

1741
03:46:45,612 --> 03:46:48,302
you bow to no one.

1742
03:47:32,429 --> 03:47:34,593
And thus it was.

1743
03:47:34,723 --> 03:47:38,382
A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.

1744
03:47:38,528 --> 03:47:41,098
And the Fellowship of the Ring...

1745
03:47:41,239 --> 03:47:45,767
though eternally bound by friendship and love...

1746
03:47:45,931 --> 03:47:48,349
was ended.

1747
03:47:53,335 --> 03:47:58,158
Thirteen months to the day since
Gandalf sent us on our long journey...

1748
03:47:58,287 --> 03:48:02,540
we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight.

1749
03:48:05,065 --> 03:48:07,790
We were home.

1750
03:48:14,345 --> 03:48:16,218
Hi.

1751
03:48:33,374 --> 03:48:35,611
Hey, watch the pumpkin.

1752
03:49:23,683 --> 03:49:25,282
More of the same, Rosie.

1753
03:49:25,456 --> 03:49:27,448
Good night, lads.

1754
03:50:24,993 --> 03:50:29,012
How do you pick up the threads of an old life?

1755
03:50:30,311 --> 03:50:32,559
How do you go on...

1756
03:50:32,709 --> 03:50:37,937
when in your heart you begin to understand...

1757
03:50:39,174 --> 03:50:42,148
there is no going back?

1758
03:50:42,823 --> 03:50:46,530
There are some things that time cannot mend...

1759
03:50:46,994 --> 03:50:49,953
some hurts that go too deep...

1760
03:50:51,686 --> 03:50:54,542
that have taken hold.

1761
03:51:32,663 --> 03:51:34,579
Mr. Frodo?

1762
03:51:37,877 --> 03:51:39,294
What is it?

1763
03:51:41,109 --> 03:51:45,080
It's been four years to the day since Weathertop, Sam.

1764
03:51:45,749 --> 03:51:48,464
It's never really healed.

1765
03:51:52,422 --> 03:51:57,688
"There and Back Again." A
Hobbit's tale by Bilbo Baggins.

1766
03:51:58,366 --> 03:52:02,224
And "The Lord of the Rings" by Frodo Baggins.

1767
03:52:02,693 --> 03:52:04,893
You finished it.

1768
03:52:07,750 --> 03:52:09,275
Not quite.

1769
03:52:10,044 --> 03:52:12,655
There's room for a little more.

1770
03:52:15,257 --> 03:52:19,500
Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end...

1771
03:52:19,636 --> 03:52:22,953
that each of us must come and go in the telling.

1772
03:52:23,807 --> 03:52:26,673
Bilbo's story was now over.

1773
03:52:27,144 --> 03:52:30,092
There would be no more journeys for him...

1774
03:52:30,220 --> 03:52:31,803
save one.

1775
03:52:32,514 --> 03:52:36,163
Tell me again, lad, where are we going?

1776
03:52:36,267 --> 03:52:38,301
To the harbor, Bilbo.

1777
03:52:38,457 --> 03:52:41,182
The Elves have accorded you a special honor...

1778
03:52:41,324 --> 03:52:43,977
a place on the last ship to leave Middle-earth.

1779
03:52:45,651 --> 03:52:47,353
Frodo...

1780
03:52:48,779 --> 03:52:53,322
any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again?

1781
03:52:53,941 --> 03:52:56,193
The one I gave you.

1782
03:52:59,832 --> 03:53:01,990
I'm sorry, Uncle.

1783
03:53:04,524 --> 03:53:07,166
I'm afraid I lost it.

1784
03:53:07,339 --> 03:53:09,131
Oh.

1785
03:53:09,685 --> 03:53:11,217
Pity.

1786
03:53:13,960 --> 03:53:17,838
I should like to have held it one last time.

1787
03:53:46,961 --> 03:53:52,044
Well, here's a sight I have never seen before.

1788
03:54:06,199 --> 03:54:09,564
The power of the Three Rings is ended.

1789
03:54:10,317 --> 03:54:13,146
The time has come...

1790
03:54:13,289 --> 03:54:16,574
for the dominion of Men.

1791
03:54:17,095 --> 03:54:20,576
I Aear can ven na mar.
(The sea calls us home.)

1792
03:54:28,981 --> 03:54:31,161
I think I'm...

1793
03:54:31,328 --> 03:54:35,715
quite ready for another adventure.

1794
03:55:06,779 --> 03:55:09,078
Farewell...

1795
03:55:09,229 --> 03:55:12,002
my brave Hobbits.

1796
03:55:13,921 --> 03:55:15,955
My work is now finished.

1797
03:55:19,760 --> 03:55:24,761
Here at last, on the shores of the sea...

1798
03:55:25,391 --> 03:55:28,268
comes the end of our Fellowship.

1799
03:55:31,803 --> 03:55:34,305
I will not say, "Do not weep"...

1800
03:55:34,983 --> 03:55:38,981
for not all tears are an evil.

1801
03:55:56,515 --> 03:55:58,455
It is time, Frodo.

1802
03:56:03,970 --> 03:56:06,004
What does he mean?

1803
03:56:08,454 --> 03:56:11,345
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.

1804
03:56:12,937 --> 03:56:15,689
And it has been saved.

1805
03:56:19,350 --> 03:56:22,029
But not for me.

1806
03:56:22,947 --> 03:56:25,403
You don't mean that.

1807
03:56:26,596 --> 03:56:28,693
You can't leave.

1808
03:56:37,128 --> 03:56:39,874
The last pages are for you, Sam.

1809
04:00:12,963 --> 04:00:15,834
My dear Sam

1810
04:00:17,760 --> 04:00:21,093
You cannot always be torn in two.

1811
04:00:21,253 --> 04:00:25,391
You will have to be one and whole for many years.

1812
04:00:25,997 --> 04:00:31,599
You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do.

1813
04:00:32,722 --> 04:00:36,024
Your part in the story will go on.

1814
04:00:36,737 --> 04:00:38,522
Well...

1815
04:00:40,386 --> 04:00:42,115
I'm back.

﻿1
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:20,588
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!

2
00:01:25,466 --> 00:01:30,802
I am a servant of the Secret
Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.

3
00:01:38,746 --> 00:01:41,510
Go back to the Shadow.

4
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:46,216
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun!

5
00:01:50,089 --> 00:01:54,583
You shall not pass!

6
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:23,415
No! No!

7
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:25,591
Gandalf!

8
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,928
Fly, you fools.

9
00:02:35,568 --> 00:02:37,433
No!

10
00:02:39,405 --> 00:02:41,464
Gandalf!

11
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:51,973
Gandalf!

12
00:03:52,978 --> 00:03:55,207
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

13
00:03:57,148 --> 00:03:58,877
Nothing.

14
00:04:06,157 --> 00:04:08,216
Just a dream.

15
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:22,599
Can you see the bottom?

16
00:04:23,874 --> 00:04:27,002
No! Don't look down, Sam! Just keep going!

17
00:04:37,855 --> 00:04:39,982
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

18
00:04:43,094 --> 00:04:45,062
Mr. Frodo!

19
00:04:47,665 --> 00:04:49,394
I think I've found the bottom.

20
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:57,797
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.

21
00:04:57,974 --> 00:05:01,205
It's not natural. None of it.

22
00:05:04,314 --> 00:05:06,373
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

23
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:08,809
Just a bit of seasoning.

24
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:12,217
I thought maybe if we was having a
roast chicken one night or something.

25
00:05:12,756 --> 00:05:14,986
Roast chicken?!

26
00:05:15,592 --> 00:05:16,854
You never know.

27
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:20,262
Sam. My dear Sam.

28
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:25,901
It's very special, that. It's
the best salt in all the Shire.

29
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,161
It is special.

30
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:34,942
It's a little bit of home.

31
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:40,682
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.

32
00:05:41,184 --> 00:05:44,642
Who's gonna follow us down here, Mr. Frodo?

33
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:49,322
It's a shame, really. Lady Galadriel gave me that.

34
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:51,960
Real Elvish rope.

35
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:55,263
Well, there's nothing for it. It's one of my knots.

36
00:05:55,431 --> 00:05:57,399
Won't come free in a hurry.

37
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:08,402
Real Elvish rope.

38
00:06:22,558 --> 00:06:27,052
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

39
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:29,424
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.

40
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:31,928
It's just where we can't get.

41
00:06:33,402 --> 00:06:36,337
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

42
00:06:38,674 --> 00:06:41,438
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.

43
00:06:43,078 --> 00:06:46,377
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam...

44
00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:48,716
...but they did.

45
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,762
Mr. Frodo?

46
00:07:06,701 --> 00:07:08,100
It's the Ring, isn't it?

47
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:11,671
It's getting heavier.

48
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,048
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

49
00:07:27,788 --> 00:07:29,847
Oh, yes. Lovely.

50
00:07:30,024 --> 00:07:32,788
Lembas bread. And look!

51
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:37,493
More lembas bread.

52
00:07:48,242 --> 00:07:50,210
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

53
00:07:50,411 --> 00:07:53,403
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

54
00:07:54,282 --> 00:07:57,740
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?

55
00:08:03,557 --> 00:08:05,855
Those rain clouds might.

56
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,924
This looks strangely familiar.

57
00:08:43,496 --> 00:08:46,021
It's because we've been here before.

58
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:48,759
We're going in circles.

59
00:08:49,502 --> 00:08:51,367
What is that horrid stink?

60
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:53,733
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

61
00:08:53,907 --> 00:08:55,841
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

62
00:08:57,877 --> 00:09:00,107
I can smell it.

63
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,784
We're not alone.

64
00:09:19,431 --> 00:09:23,527
The thieves. The thieves.

65
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:27,661
The filthy little thieves.

66
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,501
Where is it?

67
00:09:30,676 --> 00:09:33,372
Where is it?

68
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:37,276
They stole it from us.

69
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:41,681
My precious.

70
00:09:42,554 --> 00:09:45,819
Curse them, we hates them!

71
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:50,087
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

72
00:10:45,183 --> 00:10:46,980
This is Sting.

73
00:10:47,151 --> 00:10:48,675
You've seen it before...

74
00:10:48,886 --> 00:10:51,354
haven't you, Gollum?

75
00:10:55,426 --> 00:10:58,918
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

76
00:11:14,946 --> 00:11:16,708
It burns!

77
00:11:16,913 --> 00:11:19,211
It burns us!

78
00:11:20,684 --> 00:11:22,151
It freezes!

79
00:11:23,954 --> 00:11:26,218
Nasty Elves twisted it.

80
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:29,051
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

81
00:11:32,462 --> 00:11:36,728
It's hopeless. Every Orc in
Mordor's going to hear this racket.

82
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,494
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

83
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:43,261
That would kill us! Kill us!

84
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,136
It's no more than you deserve!

85
00:11:47,844 --> 00:11:49,869
Maybe he does deserve to die.

86
00:11:52,282 --> 00:11:55,718
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

87
00:11:59,189 --> 00:12:04,024
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.

88
00:12:04,261 --> 00:12:07,025
Take it off us.

89
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:14,069
We swears to do what you wants.

90
00:12:14,237 --> 00:12:16,171
We swears.

91
00:12:16,473 --> 00:12:18,907
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.

92
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,339
We swears...

93
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:28,345
to serve the master of the precious.

94
00:12:29,985 --> 00:12:32,317
We will swear on...

95
00:12:32,488 --> 00:12:34,456
on the precious.

96
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:36,818
Gollum. Gollum.

97
00:12:36,992 --> 00:12:41,122
The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word.

98
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:43,295
Yes...

99
00:12:43,866 --> 00:12:46,357
on the precious.

100
00:12:48,737 --> 00:12:51,171
On the precious.

101
00:12:52,341 --> 00:12:53,831
I don't believe you!

102
00:12:55,878 --> 00:12:59,336
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

103
00:12:59,582 --> 00:13:01,277
He's trying to trick us.

104
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,442
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.

105
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:20,392
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

106
00:13:23,338 --> 00:13:25,067
You've been there before?

107
00:13:26,074 --> 00:13:27,666
Yes.

108
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:41,214
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

109
00:13:49,797 --> 00:13:53,665
To the Gate, to the Gate! To
the Gate, the master says. Yes!

110
00:13:53,835 --> 00:13:58,636
No! We won't go back. Not there. Not to him.

111
00:13:58,806 --> 00:14:03,038
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

112
00:14:03,244 --> 00:14:06,680
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.

113
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:12,842
No. Ashes and dust and thirst
there is, and pits, pits, pits.

114
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:15,888
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

115
00:14:16,057 --> 00:14:21,188
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.

116
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:27,964
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

117
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,600
There! What did I tell you?

118
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:35,003
He's run off, the old villain.

119
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,699
So much for his promises.

120
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,469
This way, Hobbits.

121
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,771
Follow me!

122
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,028
Merry!

123
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,488
Merry!

124
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:08,771
You're late. Our master grows impatient.

125
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,772
He wants the Shire-rats now.

126
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:16,241
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

127
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:20,344
Saruman will have his prize.

128
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,717
We will deliver them.

129
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,294
Merry!

130
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,794
Merry? Wake up.

131
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,134
My friend is sick.

132
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:42,234
He needs water. Please!

133
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:46,944
Sick, is he? Give him some medicine, boys!

134
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,843
Stop it!

135
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:56,681
Can't take his draught!

136
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,918
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

137
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,827
You want some?

138
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,931
Then keep your mouth shut.

139
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,363
Merry.

140
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,764
Hello, Pip.

141
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,045
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

142
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,704
- It was just an act.
- An act?

143
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:27,250
See? I fooled you too.

144
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,684
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

145
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:35,983
What is it? What do you smell?

146
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:38,258
Man-flesh.

147
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:42,764
They've picked up our trail.

148
00:16:43,868 --> 00:16:44,994
Aragorn.

149
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:48,535
Let's move!

150
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:14,621
Their pace has quickened.

151
00:17:15,633 --> 00:17:17,601
They must have caught our scent.

152
00:17:17,769 --> 00:17:19,532
Hurry!

153
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,937
Come on, Gimli!

154
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:31,078
Three days and nights pursuit.

155
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:34,218
No food. No rest.

156
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:38,377
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.

157
00:18:09,786 --> 00:18:12,983
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.

158
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:16,690
They may yet be alive.

159
00:18:17,528 --> 00:18:20,156
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

160
00:18:22,766 --> 00:18:25,257
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

161
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:29,735
I'm wasted on cross-country. We
Dwarves are natural sprinters.

162
00:18:30,274 --> 00:18:33,539
Very dangerous over short distances.

163
00:18:45,288 --> 00:18:47,017
Rohan.

164
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:49,987
Home of the Horse-lords.

165
00:18:51,193 --> 00:18:53,753
There's something strange at work here.

166
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:56,899
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.

167
00:18:57,066 --> 00:19:00,035
Sets its will against us.

168
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:08,108
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

169
00:19:08,277 --> 00:19:10,837
The Uruks turn northeast.

170
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:13,842
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

171
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:15,979
Saruman.

172
00:19:24,393 --> 00:19:27,590
The world is changing.

173
00:19:27,763 --> 00:19:33,360
Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...

174
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,800
and Mordor?

175
00:19:38,507 --> 00:19:44,138
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman...

176
00:19:44,312 --> 00:19:47,941
and the union of the two towers?

177
00:19:54,456 --> 00:19:57,425
Together, my Lord Sauron...

178
00:19:57,592 --> 00:20:01,119
we shall rule this Middle-earth.

179
00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:21,478
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.

180
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,315
The forests will fall.

181
00:20:27,222 --> 00:20:30,089
A new order will rise.

182
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:36,062
We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...

183
00:20:36,231 --> 00:20:40,190
and the iron fists of the Orc.

184
00:20:52,713 --> 00:20:55,944
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!

185
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:57,743
But, my lord, there are too many!

186
00:20:57,918 --> 00:21:00,944
They cannot all be armed in
time, we don't have the means.

187
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:04,181
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

188
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:07,191
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.

189
00:21:08,562 --> 00:21:12,828
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.

190
00:21:14,268 --> 00:21:16,600
- Burn it.
- Yes.

191
00:21:17,337 --> 00:21:19,635
We will fight for you.

192
00:21:19,807 --> 00:21:21,775
Swear it.

193
00:21:32,286 --> 00:21:37,053
We will die for Saruman.

194
00:21:38,158 --> 00:21:40,149
The Horse-Men took your lands.

195
00:21:40,327 --> 00:21:44,855
They drove your people into the
hills to scratch a living off rocks.

196
00:21:45,032 --> 00:21:46,465
Murderers!

197
00:21:47,401 --> 00:21:49,493
Take back the lands they stole from you.

198
00:21:49,702 --> 00:21:51,465
Burn every village!

199
00:21:54,707 --> 00:21:59,838
We have only to remove those who oppose us.

200
00:22:00,313 --> 00:22:02,838
It will begin in Rohan.

201
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:07,110
Too long have these peasants stood against you.

202
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:09,083
But no more.

203
00:22:09,255 --> 00:22:11,519
Eothain! Eothain!

204
00:22:13,693 --> 00:22:16,355
You take your sister. You'll go faster with just two.

205
00:22:16,729 --> 00:22:19,391
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.

206
00:22:19,565 --> 00:22:21,226
He is too big for him.

207
00:22:21,434 --> 00:22:24,403
Listen to me. You must ride
to Edoras and raise the alarm.

208
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:27,095
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

209
00:22:27,406 --> 00:22:30,307
I don't want to leave. I don't want to go, Mama.

210
00:22:30,476 --> 00:22:34,207
Freda, I will find you there.

211
00:22:39,118 --> 00:22:40,813
Quickly!

212
00:22:47,226 --> 00:22:48,784
Go, child.

213
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:03,573
Rohan, my lord...

214
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:06,772
is ready to fall.

215
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:19,547
Theodred.

216
00:23:19,758 --> 00:23:21,385
Find the king's son!

217
00:23:37,843 --> 00:23:43,873
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.

218
00:23:44,783 --> 00:23:47,616
My Lord Eomer, over here!

219
00:23:56,427 --> 00:23:58,224
He's alive.

220
00:24:29,026 --> 00:24:31,119
Theodred.

221
00:24:44,508 --> 00:24:47,534
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

222
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:50,436
He was ambushed by Orcs.

223
00:24:51,982 --> 00:24:55,611
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

224
00:24:55,986 --> 00:24:58,476
That is a lie.

225
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:05,491
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.

226
00:25:07,163 --> 00:25:09,154
Grima.

227
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,534
Grima.

228
00:25:15,071 --> 00:25:16,561
Grima.

229
00:25:17,373 --> 00:25:20,433
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.

230
00:25:20,843 --> 00:25:24,438
Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at will.

231
00:25:25,114 --> 00:25:28,015
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

232
00:25:35,858 --> 00:25:41,626
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

233
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:44,299
Can you not see?

234
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:49,495
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent...

235
00:25:49,706 --> 00:25:52,231
your warmongering.

236
00:25:54,444 --> 00:25:56,412
Warmongering?

237
00:25:56,579 --> 00:25:58,740
How long is it since Saruman bought you?

238
00:25:59,582 --> 00:26:01,947
What was the promised price, Grima?

239
00:26:02,184 --> 00:26:05,779
When all the Men are dead, you will
take your share of the treasure?

240
00:26:18,266 --> 00:26:20,894
Too long have you watched my sister.

241
00:26:21,103 --> 00:26:23,071
Too long have you haunted her steps.

242
00:26:31,146 --> 00:26:35,480
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.

243
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:36,810
Too much.

244
00:26:39,154 --> 00:26:43,955
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan...

245
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:48,927
and all its domains under pain of death.

246
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:51,730
You have no authority here.

247
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,368
Your orders mean nothing.

248
00:26:54,903 --> 00:26:58,737
This order does not come from me.

249
00:26:58,907 --> 00:27:01,068
It comes from the king.

250
00:27:01,676 --> 00:27:04,269
He signed it this morning.

251
00:27:35,843 --> 00:27:38,539
Keep breathing. That's the key.

252
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:40,474
Breathe.

253
00:27:44,585 --> 00:27:48,419
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

254
00:28:04,572 --> 00:28:06,597
We're not going no further...

255
00:28:06,774 --> 00:28:08,764
until we've had a breather.

256
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:11,277
Get a fire going!

257
00:28:15,348 --> 00:28:16,906
Merry!

258
00:28:17,283 --> 00:28:18,614
Merry!

259
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,519
I think we might have made a
mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.

260
00:28:35,001 --> 00:28:37,196
What's making that noise?

261
00:28:38,771 --> 00:28:40,238
It's the trees.

262
00:28:40,974 --> 00:28:42,032
What?

263
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:46,209
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

264
00:28:46,379 --> 00:28:50,873
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

265
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,574
and come alive.

266
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:54,514
Alive?

267
00:28:55,388 --> 00:28:57,083
Trees that could whisper...

268
00:28:58,091 --> 00:29:00,559
talk to each other...

269
00:29:00,727 --> 00:29:02,524
even move.

270
00:29:04,164 --> 00:29:06,394
I'm starving.

271
00:29:06,566 --> 00:29:10,626
We ain't had nothing but maggoty
bread for three stinking days.

272
00:29:11,003 --> 00:29:12,265
Yeah!

273
00:29:12,471 --> 00:29:15,736
Why can't we have some meat?!

274
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,305
What about them?

275
00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:22,379
They're fresh.

276
00:29:23,048 --> 00:29:26,814
They are not for eating.

277
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:34,759
What about their legs?

278
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,258
They don't need those.

279
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,927
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!

280
00:29:43,735 --> 00:29:48,638
The prisoners go to Saruman. Alive and unspoiled.

281
00:29:49,007 --> 00:29:50,941
Alive?

282
00:29:53,912 --> 00:29:58,178
Why alive? Do they give good sport?

283
00:30:00,586 --> 00:30:03,953
They have something. An Elvish weapon.

284
00:30:04,122 --> 00:30:07,148
The master wants it for the war.

285
00:30:10,062 --> 00:30:11,927
They think we have the Ring.

286
00:30:12,097 --> 00:30:14,530
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.

287
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,368
Just a mouthful...

288
00:30:18,536 --> 00:30:19,730
a bit of the flank.

289
00:30:26,544 --> 00:30:30,105
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.

290
00:30:36,721 --> 00:30:37,983
Pippin.

291
00:30:38,155 --> 00:30:39,850
Let's go.

292
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:49,789
Go on.

293
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:51,468
Call for help.

294
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,962
Squeal.

295
00:30:54,171 --> 00:30:57,334
No one's going to save you now.

296
00:31:06,517 --> 00:31:07,916
Pippin!

297
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:34,699
A red sun rises.

298
00:31:35,211 --> 00:31:38,146
Blood has been spilled this night.

299
00:32:09,312 --> 00:32:11,177
Riders of Rohan...

300
00:32:11,614 --> 00:32:14,048
what news from the Mark?

301
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:46,213
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

302
00:32:47,015 --> 00:32:48,277
Speak quickly!

303
00:32:48,617 --> 00:32:53,281
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

304
00:33:02,431 --> 00:33:04,956
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

305
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:07,767
if it stood but a little higher from the ground.

306
00:33:08,804 --> 00:33:10,863
You would die before your stroke fell.

307
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,481
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

308
00:33:21,817 --> 00:33:26,014
This is Gimli, son of Gloin, and
Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

309
00:33:26,187 --> 00:33:29,418
We are friends of Rohan and of Theoden, your king.

310
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:34,925
Theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.

311
00:33:35,163 --> 00:33:37,358
Not even his own kin.

312
00:33:41,869 --> 00:33:43,837
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king...

313
00:33:44,005 --> 00:33:45,939
and claimed lordship over these lands.

314
00:33:47,909 --> 00:33:50,901
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

315
00:33:51,078 --> 00:33:52,841
And for that, we are banished.

316
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:58,215
The White Wizard is cunning.

317
00:33:58,886 --> 00:34:01,286
He walks here and there, they say...

318
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:03,423
as an old man hooded and cloaked.

319
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:09,125
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.

320
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,527
We are no spies.

321
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,634
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

322
00:34:14,936 --> 00:34:17,268
They have taken two of our friends captive.

323
00:34:18,072 --> 00:34:20,540
The Uruks are destroyed. We
slaughtered them during the night.

324
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:23,871
But there were two Hobbits. Did
you see two Hobbits with them?

325
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:27,013
They would be small. Only children to your eyes.

326
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,341
We left none alive.

327
00:34:32,986 --> 00:34:35,955
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

328
00:34:41,428 --> 00:34:42,656
Dead?

329
00:34:45,665 --> 00:34:47,360
I am sorry.

330
00:34:52,939 --> 00:34:55,237
Hasufel! Arod!

331
00:34:57,043 --> 00:35:01,707
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

332
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:04,508
Farewell.

333
00:35:09,723 --> 00:35:11,953
Look for your friends.

334
00:35:12,425 --> 00:35:14,655
But do not trust to hope.

335
00:35:16,363 --> 00:35:18,923
It has forsaken these lands.

336
00:35:19,132 --> 00:35:21,123
We ride north!

337
00:36:11,717 --> 00:36:13,548
It's one of their wee belts.

338
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,500
Hiro hyn hîdh ab 'wanath.
(May they find peace after death.)

339
00:36:27,366 --> 00:36:29,391
We failed them.

340
00:36:43,448 --> 00:36:45,609
A Hobbit lay here.

341
00:36:47,518 --> 00:36:49,145
And the other.

342
00:36:59,964 --> 00:37:01,556
They crawled.

343
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,763
Their hands were bound.

344
00:37:19,917 --> 00:37:21,748
Their bonds were cut.

345
00:37:37,234 --> 00:37:39,361
They ran over here.

346
00:37:43,006 --> 00:37:44,200
They were followed.

347
00:37:47,411 --> 00:37:49,140
The belt!

348
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,176
Run!

349
00:37:57,921 --> 00:37:59,252
Tracks lead away from the battle...

350
00:38:04,061 --> 00:38:06,154
into Fangorn Forest.

351
00:38:07,064 --> 00:38:08,497
Fangorn?

352
00:38:08,665 --> 00:38:11,293
What madness drove them in there?

353
00:38:29,052 --> 00:38:32,044
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

354
00:38:38,761 --> 00:38:42,197
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!

355
00:38:48,437 --> 00:38:49,426
Come here!

356
00:38:54,944 --> 00:38:57,504
Trees. Climb a tree.

357
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:08,551
He's gone.

358
00:39:20,636 --> 00:39:22,968
Merry!

359
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:38,853
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

360
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,518
Run, Merry!

361
00:39:57,305 --> 00:40:01,639
Little Orcs.

362
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:04,142
It's talking, Merry. The tree is talking.

363
00:40:04,312 --> 00:40:06,212
Tree?

364
00:40:06,381 --> 00:40:09,373
I am no tree!

365
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:11,778
I am an Ent.

366
00:40:12,353 --> 00:40:14,480
A tree-herder.

367
00:40:15,056 --> 00:40:17,024
A shepherd of the forest.

368
00:40:17,192 --> 00:40:18,557
Don't talk to it, Merry.

369
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,527
Don't encourage it!

370
00:40:20,728 --> 00:40:24,960
Treebeard, some call me.

371
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:27,101
And whose side are you on?

372
00:40:27,702 --> 00:40:29,329
Side?

373
00:40:29,537 --> 00:40:32,404
I am on nobody's side...

374
00:40:32,774 --> 00:40:38,110
because nobody's on my side, little Orc.

375
00:40:38,913 --> 00:40:43,543
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

376
00:40:43,952 --> 00:40:46,351
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

377
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,818
Hobbits?

378
00:40:50,057 --> 00:40:54,926
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

379
00:40:56,129 --> 00:41:00,623
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

380
00:41:00,801 --> 00:41:02,928
They come with fire.

381
00:41:03,136 --> 00:41:05,696
They come with axes.

382
00:41:05,906 --> 00:41:10,707
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!

383
00:41:10,911 --> 00:41:14,711
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

384
00:41:14,948 --> 00:41:17,781
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

385
00:41:17,985 --> 00:41:19,782
Halflings!

386
00:41:19,953 --> 00:41:21,045
Shire-folk!

387
00:41:21,255 --> 00:41:23,587
Maybe you are...

388
00:41:23,891 --> 00:41:27,520
and maybe you aren't.

389
00:41:28,629 --> 00:41:32,531
The White Wizard will know.

390
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:35,267
The White Wizard?

391
00:41:36,803 --> 00:41:38,293
Saruman.

392
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,544
See? See?

393
00:41:52,785 --> 00:41:55,185
We've led you out.

394
00:41:55,354 --> 00:41:57,845
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

395
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,428
Very lucky we find you.

396
00:42:10,102 --> 00:42:11,831
Nice Hobbit.

397
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,005
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

398
00:42:18,177 --> 00:42:20,805
A swamp, yes, yes.

399
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:26,279
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

400
00:42:28,621 --> 00:42:32,057
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

401
00:42:35,328 --> 00:42:37,956
I found it. I did.

402
00:42:38,164 --> 00:42:40,826
The way through the marshes.

403
00:42:41,033 --> 00:42:44,525
Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it.

404
00:42:44,737 --> 00:42:48,798
They go around for miles and miles.

405
00:42:49,008 --> 00:42:50,441
Come quickly.

406
00:42:50,643 --> 00:42:54,703
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

407
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,213
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

408
00:42:59,384 --> 00:43:01,648
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.

409
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:05,187
No, no birdses to eat.

410
00:43:05,423 --> 00:43:09,655
No crunchable birdses.

411
00:43:10,261 --> 00:43:13,128
We are famished! Yes!

412
00:43:13,298 --> 00:43:17,598
Famished we are, precious!

413
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,074
Here.

414
00:43:35,286 --> 00:43:37,277
What does it eats?

415
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,457
Is it tasty?

416
00:43:44,763 --> 00:43:47,357
It tries to chokes us!

417
00:43:47,632 --> 00:43:51,295
We can't eats Hobbit food!

418
00:43:53,004 --> 00:43:57,030
We must starve!

419
00:43:57,207 --> 00:43:59,573
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

420
00:44:00,344 --> 00:44:02,539
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

421
00:44:02,746 --> 00:44:05,579
It does not care if we be hungry.

422
00:44:05,816 --> 00:44:10,549
Does not care if we should die.

423
00:44:11,188 --> 00:44:14,021
Not like master.

424
00:44:15,392 --> 00:44:17,485
Master cares.

425
00:44:18,662 --> 00:44:20,527
Master knows.

426
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,968
Yes.

427
00:44:25,135 --> 00:44:27,763
Precious.

428
00:44:31,341 --> 00:44:34,970
Once it takes hold of us...

429
00:44:36,847 --> 00:44:41,011
it never lets go.

430
00:44:41,718 --> 00:44:42,878
Don't touch me!

431
00:45:15,351 --> 00:45:17,216
There are dead things!

432
00:45:17,386 --> 00:45:19,149
Dead faces in the water.

433
00:45:23,993 --> 00:45:27,952
All dead. All rotten.

434
00:45:28,464 --> 00:45:32,230
Elves and Men and Orcses.

435
00:45:32,435 --> 00:45:36,064
A great battle long ago.

436
00:45:36,873 --> 00:45:38,602
Dead Marshes.

437
00:45:38,808 --> 00:45:41,538
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

438
00:45:43,246 --> 00:45:44,975
This way.

439
00:45:45,181 --> 00:45:47,945
Don't follow the lights.

440
00:45:49,685 --> 00:45:53,553
Careful now! Or Hobbits go
down to join the dead ones...

441
00:45:53,756 --> 00:45:57,852
and light little candles of their own.

442
00:46:24,052 --> 00:46:25,519
Frodo!

443
00:47:09,997 --> 00:47:14,661
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

444
00:47:14,835 --> 00:47:16,700
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

445
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:18,735
Are you all right?

446
00:47:47,635 --> 00:47:50,604
So bright.

447
00:47:50,804 --> 00:47:54,604
So beautiful.

448
00:47:54,775 --> 00:47:58,643
Our precious.

449
00:48:00,114 --> 00:48:01,604
What did you say?

450
00:48:01,815 --> 00:48:03,976
Master should be resting.

451
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:08,211
Master needs to keep up his strength.

452
00:48:10,189 --> 00:48:13,454
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

453
00:48:13,626 --> 00:48:15,116
Gollum. Gollum.

454
00:48:15,295 --> 00:48:17,092
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.

455
00:48:17,263 --> 00:48:21,359
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home

456
00:48:21,534 --> 00:48:23,092
He said your life was a sad story.

457
00:48:23,303 --> 00:48:27,831
They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead

458
00:48:28,007 --> 00:48:30,999
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.

459
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,939
Were you?

460
00:48:35,181 --> 00:48:37,411
Smeagol.

461
00:48:42,121 --> 00:48:44,646
What did you call me?

462
00:48:45,992 --> 00:48:48,756
That was your name once, wasn't it?

463
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:51,695
A long time ago.

464
00:48:52,532 --> 00:48:54,693
My name.

465
00:48:55,768 --> 00:48:57,258
My name.

466
00:49:04,143 --> 00:49:06,611
Smeagol.

467
00:49:10,749 --> 00:49:12,376
Black Riders!

468
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:13,882
Hide! Hide!

469
00:49:24,463 --> 00:49:26,761
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

470
00:49:26,932 --> 00:49:30,561
Quick! They will see us! They will see us!

471
00:49:31,336 --> 00:49:33,998
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

472
00:49:34,172 --> 00:49:37,141
No, you cannot kill them. No.

473
00:50:04,302 --> 00:50:05,394
Wraiths!

474
00:50:05,604 --> 00:50:07,799
Wraiths on wings!

475
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:17,838
They are calling for it.

476
00:50:18,082 --> 00:50:21,609
They are calling for the precious.

477
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:25,881
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

478
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:27,318
I'm here.

479
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,864
Hurry, Hobbits.

480
00:50:45,443 --> 00:50:49,379
The Black Gate is very close.

481
00:50:56,253 --> 00:50:58,118
Orc blood.

482
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:09,828
These are strange tracks.

483
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:13,126
The air is so close in here.

484
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:16,704
This forest is old.

485
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:19,498
Very old.

486
00:51:21,277 --> 00:51:23,575
Full of memory...

487
00:51:26,182 --> 00:51:28,514
and anger.

488
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:37,592
The trees are speaking to each other.

489
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,250
Gimli!

490
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,363
Lower your ax.

491
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:46,931
They have feelings, my friend.

492
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:49,461
The Elves began it.

493
00:51:49,672 --> 00:51:54,405
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.

494
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:57,277
Talking trees.

495
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:00,940
What do trees have to talk about?

496
00:52:01,117 --> 00:52:04,280
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.

497
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,050
Aragorn, nad no ennas!
(Aragorn, something is out there!)

498
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:16,900
Man cenich?
(What do you see?)

499
00:52:18,234 --> 00:52:20,667
The White Wizard approaches.

500
00:52:26,875 --> 00:52:31,175
Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us.

501
00:52:40,756 --> 00:52:43,020
We must be quick.

502
00:52:58,607 --> 00:53:02,236
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.

503
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:04,210
Where are they?

504
00:53:04,379 --> 00:53:07,940
They passed this way the day before yesterday.

505
00:53:08,116 --> 00:53:12,382
They met someone they did not expect.

506
00:53:12,554 --> 00:53:14,681
Does that comfort you?

507
00:53:14,856 --> 00:53:16,824
Who are you?

508
00:53:18,293 --> 00:53:20,261
Show yourself!

509
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,161
It cannot be.

510
00:53:34,141 --> 00:53:35,108
Forgive me.

511
00:53:36,777 --> 00:53:38,711
I mistook you for Saruman.

512
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,244
I am Saruman.

513
00:53:43,784 --> 00:53:47,652
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.

514
00:53:48,623 --> 00:53:50,113
You fell.

515
00:53:51,592 --> 00:53:54,117
Through fire...

516
00:53:54,295 --> 00:53:55,592
and water.

517
00:53:57,064 --> 00:53:59,589
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...

518
00:53:59,767 --> 00:54:03,464
I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.

519
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,050
Until at last I threw down my enemy...

520
00:54:22,223 --> 00:54:26,682
and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.

521
00:54:32,699 --> 00:54:35,259
Darkness took me...

522
00:54:36,036 --> 00:54:40,097
and I strayed out of thought and time.

523
00:54:40,874 --> 00:54:43,934
Stars wheeled overhead...

524
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:48,704
and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.

525
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:52,977
But it was not the end.

526
00:54:53,219 --> 00:54:56,052
I felt life in me again.

527
00:54:57,991 --> 00:55:00,516
I've been sent back...

528
00:55:00,694 --> 00:55:02,252
until my task is done.

529
00:55:02,629 --> 00:55:04,529
Gandalf.

530
00:55:05,198 --> 00:55:07,189
Gandalf?

531
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,397
Yes.

532
00:55:12,205 --> 00:55:14,002
That was what they used to call me.

533
00:55:16,876 --> 00:55:19,140
Gandalf the Grey.

534
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,243
That was my name.

535
00:55:22,415 --> 00:55:23,848
Gandalf.

536
00:55:25,819 --> 00:55:27,878
I am Gandalf the White.

537
00:55:30,923 --> 00:55:33,983
And I come back to you now...

538
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:36,650
at the turn of the tide.

539
00:55:37,763 --> 00:55:40,732
One stage of your journey is over. Another begins.

540
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,663
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?

541
00:55:45,604 --> 00:55:47,629
That is no short distance!

542
00:55:47,906 --> 00:55:51,137
We hear of trouble in Rohan. It goes ill with the king.

543
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:53,403
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

544
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:57,015
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

545
00:55:57,182 --> 00:55:59,173
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...

546
00:55:59,351 --> 00:56:03,515
in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested...?

547
00:56:06,125 --> 00:56:09,288
I mean, charming...

548
00:56:09,461 --> 00:56:12,191
quite charming forest.

549
00:56:12,731 --> 00:56:16,394
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

550
00:56:16,602 --> 00:56:20,971
A great power has been sleeping
here for many long years.

551
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:24,576
The coming of Merry and Pippin will
be like the falling of small stones...

552
00:56:24,743 --> 00:56:28,076
that starts an avalanche in the mountains.

553
00:56:28,247 --> 00:56:31,239
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.

554
00:56:31,416 --> 00:56:35,010
You still speak in riddles.

555
00:56:37,855 --> 00:56:44,260
A thing is about to happen that has
not happened since the Elder Days.

556
00:56:44,428 --> 00:56:48,057
The Ents are going to wake up...

557
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:53,093
- and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

558
00:56:53,905 --> 00:56:55,031
Oh, that's good.

559
00:56:55,239 --> 00:56:57,935
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

560
00:56:59,043 --> 00:57:01,273
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

561
00:57:01,445 --> 00:57:05,040
In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.

562
00:57:05,216 --> 00:57:08,947
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.

563
00:57:31,242 --> 00:57:32,675
That is one of the Mearas...

564
00:57:32,844 --> 00:57:35,641
unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.

565
00:57:53,263 --> 00:57:55,527
Shadowfax.

566
00:57:58,101 --> 00:58:00,729
He is the lord of all horses...

567
00:58:02,372 --> 00:58:06,240
and has been my friend through many dangers.

568
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:24,085
O rowan mine

569
00:58:24,261 --> 00:58:28,061
I saw you shine

570
00:58:28,231 --> 00:58:31,758
Upon a summer's day

571
00:58:32,869 --> 00:58:37,329
Upon your head How golden-red

572
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:42,272
The crown you bore aloft

573
00:58:42,444 --> 00:58:44,844
Such a beautiful verse.

574
00:58:45,014 --> 00:58:49,917
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

575
00:58:50,085 --> 00:58:53,350
You might call it far, perhaps.

576
00:58:54,256 --> 00:58:58,056
My home lies deep in the forest...

577
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:02,162
near the roots of the mountain.

578
00:59:03,432 --> 00:59:07,095
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

579
00:59:07,336 --> 00:59:11,295
And safe is where I'll keep you.

580
00:59:11,573 --> 00:59:15,942
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

581
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:19,337
It's one of my own compositions.

582
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:20,709
Right.

583
00:59:20,883 --> 00:59:27,015
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves

584
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:32,058
And the dreams of trees unfold

585
00:59:32,227 --> 00:59:38,689
When woodland halls are green and cool

586
00:59:38,901 --> 00:59:42,961
And the wind is in the West

587
00:59:43,438 --> 00:59:46,100
Come back to me

588
00:59:46,641 --> 00:59:51,101
Come back to me

589
00:59:51,279 --> 00:59:57,707
And say my land is best

590
01:00:05,159 --> 01:00:08,822
Sleep, little Shirelings.

591
01:00:08,997 --> 01:00:12,592
Heed no nightly noise.

592
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:16,702
Sleep till morning light.

593
01:00:18,339 --> 01:00:22,503
I have business in the forest.

594
01:00:22,677 --> 01:00:28,206
There are many to call. Many that must come.

595
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:34,114
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

596
01:00:34,288 --> 01:00:40,124
The withering of all woods is drawing near.

597
01:00:49,569 --> 01:00:53,835
The veiling shadow that
glowers in the east takes shape.

598
01:00:54,641 --> 01:00:57,235
Sauron will suffer no rival.

599
01:00:57,677 --> 01:01:01,943
From the summit of Barad-dur,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

600
01:01:02,115 --> 01:01:05,482
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.

601
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,488
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

602
01:01:08,655 --> 01:01:11,215
The rumor has reached him.

603
01:01:11,391 --> 01:01:14,360
The heir of Numenor still lives.

604
01:01:15,328 --> 01:01:18,161
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

605
01:01:19,499 --> 01:01:21,660
He fears what you may become.

606
01:01:22,936 --> 01:01:26,372
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.

607
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:30,169
He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan.

608
01:01:30,343 --> 01:01:31,833
War is coming.

609
01:01:32,012 --> 01:01:35,573
Rohan must defend itself, and
therein lies our first challenge...

610
01:01:35,749 --> 01:01:38,183
for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

611
01:01:38,351 --> 01:01:42,048
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

612
01:01:42,222 --> 01:01:45,316
His hold over King Theoden is now very strong.

613
01:01:45,492 --> 01:01:50,190
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.

614
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:53,157
But for all their cunning...

615
01:01:53,365 --> 01:01:55,890
we have one advantage.

616
01:01:58,070 --> 01:02:00,630
The Ring remains hidden.

617
01:02:01,674 --> 01:02:03,574
And that we should seek to destroy it...

618
01:02:03,742 --> 01:02:06,711
has not yet entered their darkest dreams.

619
01:02:07,313 --> 01:02:10,612
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

620
01:02:10,783 --> 01:02:12,273
in the hands of a Hobbit.

621
01:02:12,451 --> 01:02:16,547
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.

622
01:02:16,722 --> 01:02:19,350
We must trust now in Frodo.

623
01:02:19,525 --> 01:02:21,356
Everything depends upon speed...

624
01:02:21,527 --> 01:02:24,519
and the secrecy of his quest.

625
01:02:26,499 --> 01:02:29,832
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

626
01:02:30,703 --> 01:02:33,467
Frodo must finish this task alone.

627
01:02:34,206 --> 01:02:36,538
He's not alone.

628
01:02:36,709 --> 01:02:38,404
Sam went with him.

629
01:02:39,078 --> 01:02:40,272
Did he?

630
01:02:40,446 --> 01:02:45,076
Did he, indeed? Good.

631
01:02:45,684 --> 01:02:48,118
Yes, very good.

632
01:02:56,127 --> 01:03:01,030
The Black Gate of Mordor.

633
01:03:03,768 --> 01:03:06,236
Oh, save us.

634
01:03:12,043 --> 01:03:15,274
My old Gaffer would have a thing or
two to say if he could see us now.

635
01:03:17,515 --> 01:03:21,975
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.

636
01:03:22,153 --> 01:03:25,589
So good Smeagol does, master says so.

637
01:03:25,757 --> 01:03:26,985
I did.

638
01:03:35,767 --> 01:03:37,758
That's it, then.

639
01:03:39,337 --> 01:03:40,634
We can't get past that.

640
01:04:25,816 --> 01:04:27,147
Look!

641
01:04:27,317 --> 01:04:28,784
The gate.

642
01:04:28,952 --> 01:04:30,146
It's opening!

643
01:04:37,594 --> 01:04:39,562
I can see a way down.

644
01:04:40,297 --> 01:04:42,390
Sam, no!

645
01:04:44,601 --> 01:04:45,966
Master!

646
01:06:09,751 --> 01:06:13,278
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

647
01:06:14,055 --> 01:06:17,218
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.

648
01:06:17,659 --> 01:06:19,524
- Now!
- No!

649
01:06:20,095 --> 01:06:22,063
No! No, master!

650
01:06:22,263 --> 01:06:25,232
They catch you! They catch you!

651
01:06:26,534 --> 01:06:29,094
Don't take it to him.

652
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,770
He wants the precious.

653
01:06:34,943 --> 01:06:37,969
Always he is looking for it.

654
01:06:38,146 --> 01:06:42,048
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.

655
01:06:42,283 --> 01:06:46,185
But we mustn't let him have it.

656
01:06:52,594 --> 01:06:54,687
No! There's another way.

657
01:06:54,896 --> 01:06:57,558
More secret. A dark way.

658
01:06:57,866 --> 01:07:01,529
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

659
01:07:02,003 --> 01:07:03,026
He's up to something.

660
01:07:03,637 --> 01:07:06,231
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?

661
01:07:06,407 --> 01:07:09,137
Yes. There's a path...

662
01:07:09,309 --> 01:07:11,800
and some stairs.

663
01:07:12,012 --> 01:07:13,673
And then...

664
01:07:13,847 --> 01:07:17,180
a tunnel.

665
01:07:31,198 --> 01:07:32,995
He's led us this far, Sam.

666
01:07:33,167 --> 01:07:34,566
Mr. Frodo, no.

667
01:07:35,702 --> 01:07:37,169
He's been true to his word.

668
01:07:42,042 --> 01:07:43,236
No.

669
01:07:45,379 --> 01:07:47,006
Lead the way, Smeagol.

670
01:07:47,614 --> 01:07:51,550
Good Smeagol always helps.

671
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:26,507
Hello?

672
01:08:28,921 --> 01:08:30,980
Treebeard?

673
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:33,022
Where has he gone?

674
01:08:33,226 --> 01:08:35,660
I had the loveliest dream last night.

675
01:08:36,295 --> 01:08:38,991
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.

676
01:08:39,165 --> 01:08:41,656
And we smoked all of it. And then...

677
01:08:42,168 --> 01:08:44,102
you were sick.

678
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:48,538
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

679
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:53,978
Did you hear that?

680
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:02,452
There it is again.

681
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:07,985
Something's not right here. Not right at all.

682
01:09:11,796 --> 01:09:14,731
You just said something... Treeish.

683
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:18,893
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

684
01:09:26,444 --> 01:09:28,309
You're taller.

685
01:09:28,847 --> 01:09:30,337
- Who?
- You!

686
01:09:30,515 --> 01:09:32,142
- Than what?
- Than me!

687
01:09:32,651 --> 01:09:34,778
I've always been taller than you.

688
01:09:34,953 --> 01:09:39,583
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the
tall one. You're the short one.

689
01:09:40,458 --> 01:09:41,948
Please, Merry.

690
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:45,994
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

691
01:09:46,565 --> 01:09:49,398
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

692
01:09:51,536 --> 01:09:53,800
3'8"!

693
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:57,571
Three-foot-eight.

694
01:10:00,645 --> 01:10:02,545
You did something.

695
01:10:08,353 --> 01:10:09,945
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

696
01:10:10,889 --> 01:10:12,355
Merry!

697
01:10:12,556 --> 01:10:14,888
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.

698
01:10:15,059 --> 01:10:18,961
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

699
01:10:19,129 --> 01:10:21,290
Give me it back. Merry!

700
01:10:23,133 --> 01:10:24,498
What's happening?!

701
01:10:25,369 --> 01:10:26,836
It's got my leg!

702
01:10:27,171 --> 01:10:28,661
Merry!

703
01:10:48,058 --> 01:10:49,650
Help!

704
01:10:56,433 --> 01:10:58,298
Away with you.

705
01:10:58,469 --> 01:11:00,266
You should not be waking.

706
01:11:00,771 --> 01:11:05,640
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

707
01:11:06,243 --> 01:11:08,803
Go to sleep.

708
01:11:09,146 --> 01:11:11,011
Away with you.

709
01:11:11,181 --> 01:11:14,480
Come, the forest is waking up.

710
01:11:15,052 --> 01:11:16,985
It isn't safe.

711
01:11:19,656 --> 01:11:23,592
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.

712
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,752
Anger festers in their hearts.

713
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:29,257
Black are their thoughts.

714
01:11:29,432 --> 01:11:31,957
Strong is their hate.

715
01:11:32,135 --> 01:11:34,899
They will harm you if they can.

716
01:11:35,071 --> 01:11:38,632
There are too few of us now.

717
01:11:38,808 --> 01:11:42,801
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

718
01:11:43,446 --> 01:11:46,074
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

719
01:11:46,249 --> 01:11:49,446
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.

720
01:11:49,619 --> 01:11:55,251
There have been no Entings for
a terrible long count of years.

721
01:11:55,458 --> 01:12:00,691
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.

722
01:12:00,963 --> 01:12:02,362
Oh, I'm sorry.

723
01:12:02,465 --> 01:12:06,401
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

724
01:12:06,569 --> 01:12:09,800
We lost them.

725
01:12:09,972 --> 01:12:15,035
And now we cannot find them.

726
01:12:15,211 --> 01:12:21,445
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?

727
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:24,398
Can't say that I have.

728
01:12:24,942 --> 01:12:26,967
You, Pip?

729
01:12:28,445 --> 01:12:30,845
What do they look like?

730
01:12:33,283 --> 01:12:37,947
I don't remember now.

731
01:12:54,371 --> 01:12:58,273
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.

732
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:01,670
There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan...

733
01:13:02,379 --> 01:13:05,246
whose mind is overthrown.

734
01:13:05,415 --> 01:13:09,681
Saruman's hold over King Theoden is now very strong.

735
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,483
My lord, your son...

736
01:13:13,657 --> 01:13:15,852
he is dead.

737
01:13:17,361 --> 01:13:19,158
My lord?

738
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:21,590
Uncle?

739
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,668
Will you not go to him?

740
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:36,209
Will you do nothing?

741
01:13:36,379 --> 01:13:38,347
Be careful what you say.

742
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:40,708
Do not look for welcome here.

743
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:08,904
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.

744
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:11,238
What a tragedy for the king...

745
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:14,449
to lose his only son and heir.

746
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:20,079
I understand. His passing is hard to accept.

747
01:14:20,256 --> 01:14:25,158
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.

748
01:14:25,326 --> 01:14:26,793
Leave me alone, snake!

749
01:14:28,263 --> 01:14:29,890
Oh, but you are alone.

750
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:36,300
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness...

751
01:14:36,471 --> 01:14:39,929
in the bitter watches of the night...

752
01:14:40,108 --> 01:14:43,771
when all your life seems to shrink.

753
01:14:43,978 --> 01:14:48,176
The walls of your bower closing in about you.

754
01:14:48,349 --> 01:14:52,911
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

755
01:14:55,156 --> 01:14:57,056
So fair.

756
01:14:58,326 --> 01:14:59,691
So cold.

757
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:03,624
Like a morning of pale spring...

758
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:07,268
still clinging to winter's chill.

759
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:23,540
Your words are poison.

760
01:16:56,108 --> 01:16:58,576
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

761
01:17:12,925 --> 01:17:16,725
I cannot allow you before Theoden
King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

762
01:17:18,231 --> 01:17:20,791
By order of Grima Wormtongue.

763
01:17:38,149 --> 01:17:39,912
Your staff.

764
01:17:43,321 --> 01:17:46,813
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.

765
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:08,477
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

766
01:18:16,788 --> 01:18:18,346
He's a herald of woe.

767
01:18:18,523 --> 01:18:22,960
The courtesy of your hall is
somewhat lessened of late...

768
01:18:24,062 --> 01:18:25,495
Theoden King.

769
01:18:26,197 --> 01:18:28,722
He's not welcome.

770
01:18:29,668 --> 01:18:35,004
Why should I welcome you...

771
01:18:35,507 --> 01:18:39,169
Gandalf Stormcrow?

772
01:18:39,343 --> 01:18:42,642
A just question, my liege.

773
01:18:42,813 --> 01:18:45,680
Late is the hour...

774
01:18:45,849 --> 01:18:49,808
in which this conjurer chooses to appear.

775
01:18:50,621 --> 01:18:52,680
Lathspell I name him.

776
01:18:52,856 --> 01:18:55,757
Ill news is an ill guest.

777
01:18:55,926 --> 01:19:00,488
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.

778
01:19:00,664 --> 01:19:02,598
I have not passed through fire and death...

779
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:05,931
to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.

780
01:19:06,937 --> 01:19:09,030
His staff.

781
01:19:09,239 --> 01:19:13,369
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

782
01:19:16,714 --> 01:19:18,648
Theoden...

783
01:19:19,216 --> 01:19:21,776
son of Thengel...

784
01:19:23,554 --> 01:19:25,920
too long have you sat in the Shadows.

785
01:19:28,892 --> 01:19:32,157
I would stay still if I were you.

786
01:19:32,329 --> 01:19:34,422
Hearken to me!

787
01:19:39,937 --> 01:19:42,063
I release you...

788
01:19:42,271 --> 01:19:44,239
from the spell.

789
01:19:55,785 --> 01:19:58,811
You have no power here...

790
01:19:58,988 --> 01:20:02,617
Gandalf the Grey.

791
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:13,093
I will draw you, Saruman, as
poison is drawn from a wound.

792
01:20:22,545 --> 01:20:24,069
Wait.

793
01:20:25,515 --> 01:20:29,349
If I go, Theoden dies.

794
01:20:30,052 --> 01:20:32,247
You did not kill me...

795
01:20:32,422 --> 01:20:34,617
you will not kill him.

796
01:20:38,528 --> 01:20:40,223
Rohan is mine.

797
01:20:41,697 --> 01:20:43,028
Be gone.

798
01:21:27,542 --> 01:21:29,669
I know your face.

799
01:21:34,249 --> 01:21:35,511
Eowyn.

800
01:21:37,819 --> 01:21:39,081
Eowyn.

801
01:21:47,361 --> 01:21:48,555
Gandalf?

802
01:21:49,096 --> 01:21:51,963
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

803
01:22:05,312 --> 01:22:07,906
Dark have been my dreams of late.

804
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:15,818
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

805
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:18,959
if they grasped your sword.

806
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:06,038
I've only...

807
01:23:06,239 --> 01:23:09,299
ever served you, my lord.

808
01:23:09,475 --> 01:23:14,469
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

809
01:23:15,481 --> 01:23:17,415
Send me not from your sight.

810
01:23:19,719 --> 01:23:22,449
No, my lord! No, my lord.

811
01:23:22,655 --> 01:23:23,849
Let him go.

812
01:23:24,557 --> 01:23:27,788
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.

813
01:23:36,936 --> 01:23:39,268
Get out of my way!

814
01:23:41,507 --> 01:23:44,670
Hail, Theoden King!

815
01:24:09,267 --> 01:24:11,758
Where is Theodred?

816
01:24:14,806 --> 01:24:17,366
Where is my son?

817
01:25:05,875 --> 01:25:14,400
"Bealocwealm hafað fréone frecan forth onsended...
("An evil death has set forth the noble warrior...)

818
01:25:15,450 --> 01:25:21,950
...giedd sculon singan gléomenn sorgiende."
(...A song shall sing sorrowing minstrels.")

819
01:25:22,575 --> 01:25:25,000
"On Meduselde...
("In Meduseld...)

820
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:29,600
...þæt he ma no wære...
(...that he is no more...)

821
01:25:30,690 --> 01:25:34,100
...is þurh niedig rest."
(...for his necessary rest.")

822
01:25:34,450 --> 01:25:37,500
"And mægen deorost...
(And that he is the dearest kinsman...)

823
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:40,300
...bealo..."
(...killing took him...")

824
01:25:44,562 --> 01:25:46,291
Simbelmyn?

825
01:25:51,469 --> 01:25:55,064
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forbearers.

826
01:25:58,909 --> 01:26:01,877
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.

827
01:26:03,947 --> 01:26:07,815
Alas that these evil days should be mine.

828
01:26:08,585 --> 01:26:12,988
The young perish and the old linger.

829
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:15,683
That I should live...

830
01:26:15,859 --> 01:26:19,226
to see the last days of my house.

831
01:26:20,497 --> 01:26:24,365
Theodred's death was not of your making.

832
01:26:27,403 --> 01:26:30,804
No parent should have to bury their child.

833
01:26:47,524 --> 01:26:49,389
He was strong in life.

834
01:26:50,493 --> 01:26:54,054
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

835
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:05,500
"Westu hál."
("Be thou well.")

836
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:11,250
"Ferðu, Théodred, Ferðu."
("Go thou, Théodred, go thou.)

837
01:27:38,674 --> 01:27:40,574
They had no warning.

838
01:27:40,742 --> 01:27:43,142
They were unarmed.

839
01:27:43,612 --> 01:27:47,639
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

840
01:27:48,584 --> 01:27:50,552
Rick, cot and tree.

841
01:27:50,853 --> 01:27:53,083
Where is Mama?

842
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:58,088
This is but a taste of the
terror that Saruman will unleash.

843
01:27:58,293 --> 01:28:02,627
All the more potent for he is
driven now by fear of Sauron.

844
01:28:04,233 --> 01:28:07,201
Ride out and meet him head on.

845
01:28:07,969 --> 01:28:11,461
Draw him away from your women and children.

846
01:28:11,806 --> 01:28:13,433
You must fight.

847
01:28:13,608 --> 01:28:17,442
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.

848
01:28:17,612 --> 01:28:19,239
Eomer is loyal to you.

849
01:28:19,413 --> 01:28:22,109
His men will return and fight for their king.

850
01:28:22,283 --> 01:28:26,185
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.

851
01:28:29,857 --> 01:28:32,087
Eomer cannot help us.

852
01:28:32,727 --> 01:28:34,490
I know what it is you want of me...

853
01:28:34,695 --> 01:28:37,960
but I will not bring further death to my people.

854
01:28:39,634 --> 01:28:41,329
I will not risk open war.

855
01:28:43,537 --> 01:28:46,904
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.

856
01:28:51,178 --> 01:28:52,805
When last I looked...

857
01:28:53,247 --> 01:28:56,876
Theoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.

858
01:29:03,691 --> 01:29:05,955
Then what is the king's decision?

859
01:29:11,564 --> 01:29:12,895
By order of the king...

860
01:29:13,066 --> 01:29:14,533
the city must empty.

861
01:29:15,702 --> 01:29:18,569
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

862
01:29:18,872 --> 01:29:22,774
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

863
01:29:22,976 --> 01:29:24,466
Helm's Deep.

864
01:29:24,644 --> 01:29:28,171
They flee to the mountains when
they should stand and fight.

865
01:29:28,348 --> 01:29:30,316
Who will defend them if not their king?

866
01:29:30,483 --> 01:29:32,951
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.

867
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:34,916
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.

868
01:29:35,088 --> 01:29:38,990
There is no way out of that ravine.
Theoden is walking into a trap.

869
01:29:39,192 --> 01:29:41,353
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

870
01:29:41,561 --> 01:29:43,688
What they will get is a massacre.

871
01:29:45,265 --> 01:29:47,733
Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.

872
01:29:48,635 --> 01:29:51,968
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

873
01:29:52,439 --> 01:29:55,306
He will need you before the end, Aragorn.

874
01:29:55,775 --> 01:29:58,573
The people of Rohan will need you.

875
01:29:58,945 --> 01:30:01,413
The defenses have to hold.

876
01:30:02,849 --> 01:30:04,578
They will hold.

877
01:30:08,588 --> 01:30:10,886
The Grey Pilgrim.

878
01:30:11,057 --> 01:30:13,684
That's what they used to call me.

879
01:30:13,892 --> 01:30:18,955
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

880
01:30:20,599 --> 01:30:22,794
With luck, my search will not be in vain.

881
01:30:23,335 --> 01:30:26,634
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.

882
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:30,202
At dawn, look to the east.

883
01:30:30,376 --> 01:30:31,934
Go.

884
01:30:59,271 --> 01:31:02,604
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

885
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:05,050
Fæste...
(Fast...)

886
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,200
...stille nú.
(...quiet now.)

887
01:31:11,225 --> 01:31:12,500
Fæste...
(Fast...)

888
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:17,200
Stille...
(Quiet...)

889
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:22,300
...stille...
(...quiet...)

890
01:31:22,775 --> 01:31:23,975
...stille...
(...quiet...)

891
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,200
...stille...
(...quiet...)

892
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:29,750
Lac is drefed, gefrægon. 
(A battle is stirring, you heard.)

893
01:31:37,550 --> 01:31:39,000
Hwæt nemnað ðe?
(What is your name?)

894
01:31:40,850 --> 01:31:41,500
Hwæt nemnað ðe?
(What is your name?)

895
01:31:41,646 --> 01:31:43,705
His name is Brego.

896
01:31:45,216 --> 01:31:47,116
He was my cousin's horse.

897
01:31:47,351 --> 01:31:49,148
Brego.

898
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:51,800
Ðin nama is cynglic.
(Your name is kingly.)

899
01:31:54,350 --> 01:31:56,000
Man le trasta, Brego?
(What troubles you, Brego?)

900
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:02,900
Man cenich?
(What did you see?)

901
01:32:03,868 --> 01:32:06,268
I have heard of the magic of Elves...

902
01:32:06,437 --> 01:32:09,736
but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.

903
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:13,209
You speak as one of their own.

904
01:32:15,012 --> 01:32:17,446
I was raised in Rivendell...

905
01:32:17,715 --> 01:32:19,238
for a time.

906
01:32:22,552 --> 01:32:24,577
Turn this fellow free.

907
01:32:25,255 --> 01:32:27,723
He's seen enough of war.

908
01:32:39,503 --> 01:32:42,370
Gandalf the White.

909
01:32:42,539 --> 01:32:44,905
Gandalf the Fool!

910
01:32:46,176 --> 01:32:50,237
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?

911
01:32:51,481 --> 01:32:55,417
There were three who followed the wizard.

912
01:32:55,819 --> 01:33:01,189
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

913
01:33:01,558 --> 01:33:04,288
You stink of horse.

914
01:33:09,566 --> 01:33:11,431
The Man...

915
01:33:13,470 --> 01:33:17,668
- was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.

916
01:33:17,841 --> 01:33:21,640
One of the Dunedain Rangers, I thought he was.

917
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:23,607
His cloth was poor.

918
01:33:24,513 --> 01:33:29,644
And yet he bore a strange ring.

919
01:33:30,753 --> 01:33:34,280
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

920
01:33:34,490 --> 01:33:40,326
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.

921
01:33:40,496 --> 01:33:42,396
The Ring of Barahir.

922
01:33:43,365 --> 01:33:46,960
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

923
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:50,469
The lost king of Gondor. He is a fool.

924
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:53,369
The line was broken years ago.

925
01:33:54,743 --> 01:33:56,267
It matters not.

926
01:33:56,445 --> 01:33:58,970
The world of Men shall fall.

927
01:33:59,148 --> 01:34:01,013
It will begin at Edoras.

928
01:34:10,192 --> 01:34:12,126
I am ready, Gamling.

929
01:34:12,294 --> 01:34:14,762
Bring my horse.

930
01:34:17,933 --> 01:34:19,298
This is not a defeat.

931
01:34:21,704 --> 01:34:22,932
We will return.

932
01:34:28,376 --> 01:34:30,776
We will return.

933
01:34:54,202 --> 01:34:56,136
You have some skill with a blade.

934
01:35:04,579 --> 01:35:06,672
Women of this country learned long ago:

935
01:35:06,848 --> 01:35:09,476
Those without swords can still die upon them.

936
01:35:09,651 --> 01:35:11,482
I fear neither death nor pain.

937
01:35:12,754 --> 01:35:14,847
What do you fear, my lady?

938
01:35:18,259 --> 01:35:20,090
A cage.

939
01:35:21,396 --> 01:35:25,230
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.

940
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:29,301
And all chance of valor has
gone beyond recall or desire.

941
01:35:32,739 --> 01:35:34,764
You're a daughter of kings...

942
01:35:36,043 --> 01:35:39,342
a shield maiden of Rohan.

943
01:35:44,651 --> 01:35:47,142
I do not think that would be your fate.

944
01:36:20,220 --> 01:36:23,212
Theoden will not stay at Edoras.

945
01:36:23,423 --> 01:36:25,482
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

946
01:36:25,692 --> 01:36:28,593
He will expect an attack on the city.

947
01:36:29,896 --> 01:36:33,160
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

948
01:36:33,332 --> 01:36:35,664
the great fortress of Rohan.

949
01:36:36,869 --> 01:36:41,272
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.

950
01:36:42,708 --> 01:36:44,437
They will be slow.

951
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:49,247
They will have women and children with them.

952
01:36:53,152 --> 01:36:55,382
Send out your Warg-riders.

953
01:37:10,236 --> 01:37:13,137
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.

954
01:37:13,305 --> 01:37:15,967
- Why do you do that?
- What?

955
01:37:16,142 --> 01:37:18,667
Call him names. Run him down all the time.

956
01:37:19,111 --> 01:37:21,136
Because.

957
01:37:22,681 --> 01:37:24,808
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

958
01:37:25,017 --> 01:37:27,178
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.

959
01:37:27,653 --> 01:37:30,417
It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about.

960
01:37:30,589 --> 01:37:32,853
You have no idea what it did to him...

961
01:37:33,025 --> 01:37:35,492
what it's still doing to him.

962
01:37:37,729 --> 01:37:39,822
I want to help him, Sam.

963
01:37:39,998 --> 01:37:41,260
Why?

964
01:37:46,571 --> 01:37:49,699
Because I have to believe he can come back.

965
01:37:53,945 --> 01:37:55,879
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

966
01:37:56,047 --> 01:37:58,777
What do you know about it? Nothing!

967
01:38:05,690 --> 01:38:09,888
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.

968
01:38:10,728 --> 01:38:11,854
I do.

969
01:38:13,898 --> 01:38:15,763
It's the Ring.

970
01:38:16,334 --> 01:38:17,892
You can't take your eyes off it.

971
01:38:18,636 --> 01:38:20,604
I've seen you.

972
01:38:21,072 --> 01:38:24,906
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

973
01:38:26,678 --> 01:38:28,908
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

974
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:31,776
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

975
01:38:31,983 --> 01:38:34,918
The Ring was entrusted to me. It's my task.

976
01:38:35,086 --> 01:38:36,781
Mine! My own!

977
01:38:37,654 --> 01:38:39,747
Can't you hear yourself?

978
01:38:39,957 --> 01:38:41,618
Don't you know who you sound like?

979
01:38:51,902 --> 01:38:54,029
We wants it.

980
01:38:54,204 --> 01:38:56,900
We needs it.

981
01:38:57,074 --> 01:39:01,875
Must have the precious.

982
01:39:02,045 --> 01:39:05,412
They stole it from us.

983
01:39:05,616 --> 01:39:08,983
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

984
01:39:09,152 --> 01:39:13,054
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

985
01:39:13,223 --> 01:39:16,488
No. Not master.

986
01:39:16,660 --> 01:39:20,494
Yes, precious. False.

987
01:39:20,664 --> 01:39:25,158
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

988
01:39:26,303 --> 01:39:28,771
Master's my friend.

989
01:39:28,939 --> 01:39:34,002
You don't have any friends. Nobody likes you.

990
01:39:35,279 --> 01:39:37,770
Not listening. I'm not listening.

991
01:39:37,948 --> 01:39:41,940
You're a liar and a thief.

992
01:39:42,618 --> 01:39:44,142
No.

993
01:39:45,087 --> 01:39:47,988
Murderer.

994
01:39:50,459 --> 01:39:51,483
Go away.

995
01:39:51,661 --> 01:39:54,027
Go away?

996
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:58,830
I hate you.

997
01:39:59,001 --> 01:40:01,401
I hate you.

998
01:40:01,704 --> 01:40:05,003
Where would you be without me? Gollum. Gollum.

999
01:40:05,174 --> 01:40:07,005
I saved us.

1000
01:40:07,176 --> 01:40:11,704
It was me. We survived because of me.

1001
01:40:12,949 --> 01:40:16,510
Not anymore.

1002
01:40:17,887 --> 01:40:19,411
What did you say?

1003
01:40:21,524 --> 01:40:25,358
Master looks after us now.

1004
01:40:25,528 --> 01:40:29,020
We don't need you.

1005
01:40:29,732 --> 01:40:31,290
What?

1006
01:40:31,467 --> 01:40:33,230
Leave now...

1007
01:40:33,402 --> 01:40:37,202
and never come back.

1008
01:40:37,373 --> 01:40:38,397
No.

1009
01:40:38,908 --> 01:40:43,106
Leave now and never come back.

1010
01:40:45,747 --> 01:40:51,652
Leave now and never come back!

1011
01:41:03,565 --> 01:41:06,261
We told him to go away.

1012
01:41:06,434 --> 01:41:09,403
And away he goes, precious.

1013
01:41:09,571 --> 01:41:11,562
Gone! Gone! Gone!

1014
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:13,571
Smeagol is free!

1015
01:41:18,446 --> 01:41:19,936
Look.

1016
01:41:20,148 --> 01:41:24,608
Look. See what Smeagol finds?

1017
01:41:34,162 --> 01:41:35,595
They are young.

1018
01:41:35,764 --> 01:41:38,289
They are tender. They are nice.

1019
01:41:38,466 --> 01:41:41,993
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

1020
01:41:44,706 --> 01:41:46,298
You'll make him sick, you will...

1021
01:41:47,508 --> 01:41:49,703
behaving like that.

1022
01:41:52,146 --> 01:41:54,876
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.

1023
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:00,643
What's it doing?

1024
01:42:01,388 --> 01:42:03,982
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

1025
01:42:04,158 --> 01:42:06,353
It ruins it.

1026
01:42:06,527 --> 01:42:10,156
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat on them.

1027
01:42:14,301 --> 01:42:16,861
What we need is a few good taters.

1028
01:42:17,738 --> 01:42:20,798
What's taters, precious?

1029
01:42:20,974 --> 01:42:22,703
What's taters? Eh?

1030
01:42:22,876 --> 01:42:24,605
Po-ta-toes.

1031
01:42:24,945 --> 01:42:28,176
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.

1032
01:42:29,717 --> 01:42:35,178
Lovely, big, golden chips with
a nice piece of fried fish.

1033
01:42:36,523 --> 01:42:38,423
Even you couldn't say no to that.

1034
01:42:38,759 --> 01:42:40,954
Oh, yes, we could.

1035
01:42:41,128 --> 01:42:44,620
Spoil a nice fish.

1036
01:42:45,899 --> 01:42:48,527
Give it to us raw...

1037
01:42:48,702 --> 01:42:51,727
and wriggling.

1038
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:55,032
You keep nasty chips.

1039
01:42:55,975 --> 01:42:58,034
You're hopeless.

1040
01:43:10,523 --> 01:43:12,013
Mr. Frodo?

1041
01:43:29,909 --> 01:43:32,571
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.

1042
01:43:32,779 --> 01:43:35,247
Servants of Sauron.

1043
01:43:36,048 --> 01:43:38,209
They are called to Mordor.

1044
01:43:38,417 --> 01:43:41,409
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.

1045
01:43:41,621 --> 01:43:44,784
It won't be long now. He will soon be ready.

1046
01:43:46,359 --> 01:43:50,022
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

1047
01:43:50,196 --> 01:43:55,360
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.

1048
01:43:55,634 --> 01:43:58,694
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

1049
01:43:58,870 --> 01:44:00,098
Mr. Frodo.

1050
01:44:00,605 --> 01:44:02,232
Look.

1051
01:44:05,811 --> 01:44:08,109
It's an oliphaunt.

1052
01:44:16,321 --> 01:44:19,347
No one at home will believe this.

1053
01:44:30,502 --> 01:44:32,367
Smeagol?

1054
01:45:12,743 --> 01:45:15,211
We've lingered here too long.

1055
01:45:18,215 --> 01:45:19,546
Come on, Sam.

1056
01:45:33,030 --> 01:45:35,726
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

1057
01:45:37,434 --> 01:45:42,531
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

1058
01:45:42,706 --> 01:45:45,607
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

1059
01:45:47,011 --> 01:45:50,378
Those that claim to oppose the
enemy would do well not to hinder us.

1060
01:45:50,547 --> 01:45:52,572
The enemy?

1061
01:45:54,685 --> 01:45:58,177
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.

1062
01:46:00,623 --> 01:46:02,682
You wonder what his name is...

1063
01:46:04,193 --> 01:46:06,457
where he came from.

1064
01:46:08,431 --> 01:46:10,865
And if he was really evil at heart.

1065
01:46:12,535 --> 01:46:15,993
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

1066
01:46:17,607 --> 01:46:20,098
If he would not rather have stayed there...

1067
01:46:22,312 --> 01:46:23,802
in peace.

1068
01:46:27,383 --> 01:46:30,409
War will make corpses of us all.

1069
01:46:30,586 --> 01:46:32,645
Bind their hands.

1070
01:46:39,534 --> 01:46:42,230
It's true, you don't see many Dwarf women.

1071
01:46:42,437 --> 01:46:46,100
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance...

1072
01:46:46,274 --> 01:46:49,436
that they're often mistaken for Dwarf men.

1073
01:46:49,843 --> 01:46:51,743
It's the beards.

1074
01:46:51,945 --> 01:46:54,073
This, in turn, has given rise to the belief...

1075
01:46:54,248 --> 01:46:57,116
that there are no Dwarf women...

1076
01:46:57,284 --> 01:47:01,551
and that Dwarves just spring
out of holes in the ground...

1077
01:47:03,223 --> 01:47:05,088
which is, of course, ridiculous.

1078
01:47:11,231 --> 01:47:13,461
It's all right. Nobody panic.

1079
01:47:13,934 --> 01:47:15,959
That was deliberate. It was deliberate.

1080
01:47:17,904 --> 01:47:21,704
I haven't seen my niece smile for a long time.

1081
01:47:21,974 --> 01:47:24,739
She was a girl when they brought her father back dead.

1082
01:47:24,911 --> 01:47:27,210
Cut down by Orcs.

1083
01:47:27,380 --> 01:47:30,373
She watched her mother succumb to grief.

1084
01:47:30,984 --> 01:47:35,613
Then she was left alone, to
tend her king in growing fear.

1085
01:47:35,788 --> 01:47:40,350
Doomed to wait upon an old man who
should have loved her as a father.

1086
01:47:50,369 --> 01:47:52,735
Gimli.

1087
01:47:52,905 --> 01:47:54,964
No, I couldn't

1088
01:47:55,141 --> 01:47:56,972
I really couldn't.

1089
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:03,107
I made some stew.

1090
01:48:03,281 --> 01:48:06,547
It isn't much, but it's hot.

1091
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:16,418
Thank you.

1092
01:48:36,914 --> 01:48:39,440
- It's good.
- Really?

1093
01:48:43,421 --> 01:48:46,788
My uncle told me a strange thing.

1094
01:48:48,092 --> 01:48:52,153
He said that you rode to war
with Thengel, my grandfather.

1095
01:48:52,596 --> 01:48:55,065
But he must be mistaken.

1096
01:48:55,332 --> 01:48:59,736
King Theoden has a good memory. He
was only a small child at the time.

1097
01:49:00,871 --> 01:49:04,069
Then you must be at least 60.

1098
01:49:06,177 --> 01:49:07,735
Seventy?

1099
01:49:08,179 --> 01:49:09,841
But you cannot be 80!

1100
01:49:13,184 --> 01:49:14,549
Eighty-seven.

1101
01:49:17,655 --> 01:49:19,748
You are one of the Dunedain.

1102
01:49:20,824 --> 01:49:23,918
A descendant of Numenor, blessed with long life.

1103
01:49:25,162 --> 01:49:27,790
It was said that your race had passed into legend.

1104
01:49:28,465 --> 01:49:30,228
There are few of us left.

1105
01:49:30,402 --> 01:49:33,164
The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.

1106
01:49:33,938 --> 01:49:37,339
I'm sorry. Please, eat.

1107
01:49:51,989 --> 01:49:56,118
The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane.

1108
01:49:56,926 --> 01:50:00,362
It is mine to give to whom I will.

1109
01:50:02,198 --> 01:50:04,598
Like my heart.

1110
01:50:06,035 --> 01:50:08,731
Go to sleep.

1111
01:50:08,905 --> 01:50:11,396
I am asleep.

1112
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:19,814
This is a dream.

1113
01:50:22,050 --> 01:50:25,248
Then it is a good dream.

1114
01:50:37,233 --> 01:50:39,325
Sleep.

1115
01:51:03,965 --> 01:51:05,550
Minlû pedich nin...
(You told me once...)

1116
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:09,350
...i aur hen telitha.
(...this day would come.)

1117
01:51:11,060 --> 01:51:13,750
Ú i vethed...nâ i onnad.
(This is not the end...it is the beginning.)

1118
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:16,250
Boe bedich go Frodo.
(You must go with Frodo.)

1119
01:51:16,950 --> 01:51:18,650
Han bâd lîn.
(That is your path.)

1120
01:51:29,625 --> 01:51:31,250
Dolen i vâd o nin.
(My path is hidden from me.)

1121
01:51:32,725 --> 01:51:35,950
Si peliannen i vâd na dail lîn.
(It is already laid before your feet.)

1122
01:51:36,900 --> 01:51:38,900
Si boe ú-dhannathach.
(You cannot falter now.)

1123
01:51:42,296 --> 01:51:44,195
Arwen...

1124
01:51:46,290 --> 01:51:48,850
Ae ú-esteliach nad...
(If you trust nothing else...)

1125
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:51,000
...estelio han...
(...trust this...)

1126
01:51:51,950 --> 01:51:54,200
...estelio ammen.
(...trust us.)

1127
01:52:33,646 --> 01:52:35,477
Where is she?

1128
01:52:36,649 --> 01:52:39,083
The woman who gave you that jewel.

1129
01:52:42,389 --> 01:52:45,152
Our time here is ending.

1130
01:52:45,859 --> 01:52:48,383
Arwen's time is ending.

1131
01:52:49,162 --> 01:52:50,423
Let her go.

1132
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:52,587
Let her take the ship into the west.

1133
01:52:52,799 --> 01:52:55,859
Let her bear away her love
for you to the Undying Lands.

1134
01:52:56,035 --> 01:52:57,832
There it will be ever green.

1135
01:52:59,338 --> 01:53:01,704
But never more than memory.

1136
01:53:02,975 --> 01:53:06,001
I will not leave my daughter here to die.

1137
01:53:06,178 --> 01:53:09,807
- She stays because she still has hope.
- She stays for you.

1138
01:53:09,982 --> 01:53:12,280
She belongs with her people.

1139
01:53:24,290 --> 01:53:25,575
Nach gwannatha sin?
(Is this how you leave?)

1140
01:53:27,530 --> 01:53:30,750
Ma nathach hi gwannathachor minuial archened?
(Did you think you could slip away at first light unseen?)

1141
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:34,900
Ú-ethelithon.
(I shall not return.)

1142
01:53:36,650 --> 01:53:39,000
Estelio guru lîn ne dagor.
(You underestimate your skill in battle.)

1143
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:40,400
Ethelithach.
(You will return.)

1144
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:41,900
Ú-bedin o gurth ne dagor.
(I do not speak of death in battle.)

1145
01:53:42,875 --> 01:53:43,850
O man pedich?
(What do you speak of?)

1146
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:51,100
Edra le men...
(The way is open to you...)


1147
01:53:52,190 --> 01:53:53,500
...men na guil edwen...
(...the way to another life...)

1148
01:53:55,890 --> 01:53:59,225
...haer o auth...a nîr a naeth.
(...away from war...grief, despair.)

1149
01:54:00,598 --> 01:54:02,429
Why are you saying this?

1150
01:54:04,001 --> 01:54:07,198
I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.

1151
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:11,301
It was a dream, Arwen.

1152
01:54:11,742 --> 01:54:13,106
Nothing more.

1153
01:54:14,479 --> 01:54:17,709
I don't believe you.

1154
01:54:26,724 --> 01:54:28,554
This belongs to you.

1155
01:54:31,328 --> 01:54:32,886
It was a gift.

1156
01:54:35,499 --> 01:54:37,023
Keep it.

1157
01:54:39,536 --> 01:54:40,731
My lord?

1158
01:54:43,540 --> 01:54:48,102
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

1159
01:55:11,601 --> 01:55:13,067
What is it?

1160
01:55:14,570 --> 01:55:16,629
- Hama?
- I'm not sure.

1161
01:55:33,155 --> 01:55:35,179
Wargs!

1162
01:55:47,736 --> 01:55:49,431
A scout!

1163
01:55:55,743 --> 01:55:58,268
- What is it? What do you see?
- Warg! We're under attack!

1164
01:55:59,614 --> 01:56:01,809
Get them out of here!

1165
01:56:06,588 --> 01:56:08,579
All riders to the head of the column.

1166
01:56:09,324 --> 01:56:11,293
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

1167
01:56:11,492 --> 01:56:13,221
Come on!

1168
01:56:25,039 --> 01:56:27,472
You must lead the people to
Helm's Deep, and make haste.

1169
01:56:27,674 --> 01:56:29,142
- I can fight.
- No!

1170
01:56:31,846 --> 01:56:33,905
You must do this, for me.

1171
01:56:35,917 --> 01:56:37,509
Follow me!

1172
01:56:41,055 --> 01:56:45,354
- Forward. I mean, charge forward.
- Make for the lower ground!

1173
01:56:45,559 --> 01:56:48,222
- That's it! Go on!
- Stay together!

1174
01:58:00,432 --> 01:58:02,731
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

1175
01:58:05,538 --> 01:58:07,095
That one counts as mine!

1176
01:58:23,822 --> 01:58:25,449
Stinking creature.

1177
01:59:52,643 --> 01:59:54,542
Aragorn!

1178
01:59:59,282 --> 02:00:00,749
Aragorn?

1179
02:00:14,729 --> 02:00:17,664
Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing.

1180
02:00:17,834 --> 02:00:19,266
He's...

1181
02:00:19,836 --> 02:00:21,428
dead.

1182
02:00:22,071 --> 02:00:24,971
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

1183
02:00:28,577 --> 02:00:29,874
You lie.

1184
02:01:03,778 --> 02:01:05,370
Get the wounded on horses.

1185
02:01:06,715 --> 02:01:09,842
The wolves of Isengard will return.

1186
02:01:10,284 --> 02:01:12,377
Leave the dead.

1187
02:01:19,827 --> 02:01:21,317
Come.

1188
02:01:31,506 --> 02:01:33,029
- At last!
- Helm's Deep.

1189
02:01:33,208 --> 02:01:36,108
There it is, Helm's Deep.

1190
02:01:38,678 --> 02:01:40,476
We're safe!

1191
02:01:42,016 --> 02:01:44,883
We're safe, my lady.

1192
02:01:45,051 --> 02:01:46,246
Thank you.

1193
02:02:30,630 --> 02:02:32,029
- Mama!
- Eothain!

1194
02:02:32,197 --> 02:02:33,688
Freda!

1195
02:02:39,438 --> 02:02:42,272
- Where is the rest?
- This is all we could save, my lady.

1196
02:02:46,145 --> 02:02:47,441
Take it to the caves.

1197
02:02:47,646 --> 02:02:50,479
Make way for the king.

1198
02:02:51,516 --> 02:02:55,316
Make way for Theoden. Make way for the king.

1199
02:03:03,228 --> 02:03:06,959
So few. So few of you have returned.

1200
02:03:09,734 --> 02:03:11,999
Our people are safe.

1201
02:03:13,337 --> 02:03:15,898
We have paid for it with many lives.

1202
02:03:16,741 --> 02:03:18,266
My lady.

1203
02:03:22,013 --> 02:03:24,277
Lord Aragorn...

1204
02:03:24,449 --> 02:03:25,677
where is he?

1205
02:03:27,685 --> 02:03:29,210
He fell.

1206
02:03:51,875 --> 02:03:54,845
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

1207
02:03:55,012 --> 02:03:57,947
Bar the gate. And set a watch on the surround.

1208
02:03:58,182 --> 02:04:01,275
What of those who cannot fight,
my lord? The women and children?

1209
02:04:01,452 --> 02:04:04,046
Get them into the caves.

1210
02:04:04,922 --> 02:04:09,790
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

1211
02:04:11,829 --> 02:04:15,230
Helm's Deep has one weakness.

1212
02:04:15,398 --> 02:04:17,731
Its outer wall is solid rock...

1213
02:04:17,901 --> 02:04:20,996
but for a small culvert at its base...

1214
02:04:21,171 --> 02:04:23,935
which is little more than a drain.

1215
02:04:26,810 --> 02:04:30,974
How? How can fire undo stone?

1216
02:04:31,148 --> 02:04:35,641
What kind of device could bring down the wall?

1217
02:04:39,254 --> 02:04:43,248
If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.

1218
02:04:43,425 --> 02:04:46,952
Even if it is breached, it would
take a number beyond reckoning...

1219
02:04:47,130 --> 02:04:49,690
thousands, to storm the Keep.

1220
02:04:49,866 --> 02:04:51,298
Tens of thousands.

1221
02:04:51,467 --> 02:04:55,528
But, my lord, there is no such force.

1222
02:05:07,483 --> 02:05:10,577
A new power is rising.

1223
02:05:10,752 --> 02:05:13,744
Its victory is at hand.

1224
02:05:19,429 --> 02:05:21,486
This night...

1225
02:05:21,930 --> 02:05:26,263
the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan!

1226
02:05:26,435 --> 02:05:29,768
March to Helm's Deep!

1227
02:05:29,938 --> 02:05:33,374
Leave none alive!

1228
02:05:35,911 --> 02:05:38,378
To war!

1229
02:05:42,316 --> 02:05:46,777
There will be no dawn for Men.

1230
02:06:03,972 --> 02:06:06,029
Look. There's smoke to the south.

1231
02:06:06,240 --> 02:06:09,368
There is always smoke rising...

1232
02:06:09,610 --> 02:06:13,444
from Isengard these days.

1233
02:06:13,681 --> 02:06:15,273
Isengard?

1234
02:06:15,483 --> 02:06:17,348
There was a time...

1235
02:06:17,685 --> 02:06:21,211
when Saruman would walk in my woods.

1236
02:06:21,388 --> 02:06:24,756
But now he has a mind of metal...

1237
02:06:25,426 --> 02:06:27,859
and wheels.

1238
02:06:28,629 --> 02:06:33,123
He no longer cares for growing things.

1239
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:35,097
What is it?

1240
02:06:40,106 --> 02:06:42,301
It's Saruman's army.

1241
02:06:42,509 --> 02:06:44,033
The war has started.

1242
02:07:22,414 --> 02:07:26,783
May the grace of the Valar protect you.

1243
02:07:59,051 --> 02:08:00,915
Brego.

1244
02:08:27,044 --> 02:08:28,239
Arwen.

1245
02:08:29,450 --> 02:08:30,250
Tollen i lû.
(It is time.)

1246
02:08:33,230 --> 02:08:37,250
I chair gwannar na Valannor. Si bado, no círar.
(The ships are leaving for Valinor. Go now before it is too late.)

1247
02:08:38,022 --> 02:08:39,818
I have made my choice.

1248
02:08:46,263 --> 02:08:49,130
He is not coming back.

1249
02:08:50,567 --> 02:08:53,900
Why do you linger here when there is no hope?

1250
02:08:54,838 --> 02:08:57,808
There is still hope.

1251
02:09:01,978 --> 02:09:05,744
If Aragorn survives this war, you will still be parted.

1252
02:09:09,152 --> 02:09:12,121
If Sauron is defeated and Aragorn made king...

1253
02:09:12,289 --> 02:09:14,780
and all that you hope for comes true...

1254
02:09:14,958 --> 02:09:19,656
you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

1255
02:09:19,929 --> 02:09:22,922
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time...

1256
02:09:23,099 --> 02:09:26,069
Aragorn will die.

1257
02:09:28,905 --> 02:09:31,430
And there will be no comfort for you...

1258
02:09:31,641 --> 02:09:35,804
no comfort to ease the pain of his passing.

1259
02:09:38,615 --> 02:09:41,345
He will come to death...

1260
02:09:41,517 --> 02:09:44,111
an image of the splendor of the kings of Men...

1261
02:09:44,287 --> 02:09:48,950
in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world.

1262
02:09:58,067 --> 02:10:02,003
But you, my daughter...

1263
02:10:02,837 --> 02:10:07,865
you will linger on in darkness and in doubt...

1264
02:10:08,043 --> 02:10:12,104
as nightfall in winter that comes without a star.

1265
02:10:14,517 --> 02:10:16,916
Here you will dwell...

1266
02:10:17,086 --> 02:10:21,988
bound to your grief under the fading trees...

1267
02:10:23,726 --> 02:10:25,716
until all the world is changed...

1268
02:10:25,894 --> 02:10:30,389
and the long years of your life are utterly spent.

1269
02:10:38,907 --> 02:10:40,067
Arwen.

1270
02:10:46,714 --> 02:10:48,977
There is nothing for you here...

1271
02:10:49,650 --> 02:10:51,743
only death.

1272
02:11:12,350 --> 02:11:14,750
A im ú-'erin veleth lîn?
(And I, do I not have your love?)

1273
02:11:17,150 --> 02:11:19,100
Gerich meleth nîn, ada.
(You have my love, father.)

1274
02:12:10,200 --> 02:12:12,450
I amar prestar aen.
(The world is changed.)

1275
02:12:13,900 --> 02:12:15,500
Han mathon ne nen.
(I feel it in the water.)

1276
02:12:16,250 --> 02:12:18,250
Han mathon ne chae,
(I feel it in the earth,)

1277
02:12:19,980 --> 02:12:24,500
a han noston ned 'wilith.
(and I smell it in the air.)

1278
02:12:25,210 --> 02:12:28,839
The power of the enemy is growing.

1279
02:12:29,015 --> 02:12:31,642
Sauron will use his puppet, Saruman...

1280
02:12:31,816 --> 02:12:35,184
to destroy the people of Rohan.

1281
02:12:37,255 --> 02:12:40,884
Isengard has been unleashed.

1282
02:12:45,230 --> 02:12:48,597
The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor...

1283
02:12:49,734 --> 02:12:52,702
the last free kingdom of Men.

1284
02:12:52,904 --> 02:12:57,307
His war on this country will come swiftly.

1285
02:13:01,011 --> 02:13:04,105
He senses the Ring is close.

1286
02:13:04,282 --> 02:13:07,740
The strength of the Ring-bearer is failing.

1287
02:13:07,919 --> 02:13:11,980
In his heart, Frodo begins to understand...

1288
02:13:13,525 --> 02:13:17,392
the quest will claim his life.

1289
02:13:17,561 --> 02:13:19,723
You know this.

1290
02:13:20,364 --> 02:13:23,197
You have foreseen it.

1291
02:13:25,303 --> 02:13:28,738
It is the risk we all took.

1292
02:13:33,077 --> 02:13:37,275
In the gathering dark, the
will of the Ring grows strong.

1293
02:13:38,449 --> 02:13:42,886
It works hard now to find its
way back into the hands of Men.

1294
02:13:43,053 --> 02:13:48,513
Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.

1295
02:13:48,725 --> 02:13:52,287
The young captain of Gondor
has but to extend his hand...

1296
02:13:52,495 --> 02:13:56,556
take the Ring for his own, and the world will fall.

1297
02:13:59,003 --> 02:14:00,833
It is close now.

1298
02:14:01,004 --> 02:14:05,270
So close to achieving its goal.

1299
02:14:08,378 --> 02:14:12,008
For Sauron will have dominion
over all life on this Earth...

1300
02:14:12,182 --> 02:14:16,311
even unto to the ending of the world.

1301
02:14:18,153 --> 02:14:19,985
The time of the Elves...

1302
02:14:20,188 --> 02:14:22,123
is over.

1303
02:14:22,959 --> 02:14:26,554
Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?

1304
02:14:28,531 --> 02:14:31,795
Do we let them stand alone?

1305
02:14:36,338 --> 02:14:37,703
What news?

1306
02:14:37,874 --> 02:14:40,672
Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan.

1307
02:14:40,843 --> 02:14:43,710
Theoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep.

1308
02:14:43,880 --> 02:14:47,907
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

1309
02:14:48,083 --> 02:14:50,483
Sauron is marshaling an army.

1310
02:14:50,819 --> 02:14:52,946
Easterlings and Southrons are at the Black Gate.

1311
02:14:53,122 --> 02:14:56,523
- How many?
- Some thousands. More come every day.

1312
02:14:57,627 --> 02:15:01,187
- Who's covering the river to the north?
- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

1313
02:15:01,396 --> 02:15:04,422
If their city is attacked, we won't hold it.

1314
02:15:06,568 --> 02:15:08,763
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

1315
02:15:08,937 --> 02:15:11,633
Sauron from Mordor.

1316
02:15:12,941 --> 02:15:16,172
The fight will come to Men on both fronts.

1317
02:15:16,343 --> 02:15:18,038
Gondor is weak.

1318
02:15:18,213 --> 02:15:21,340
Sauron will strike us soon.

1319
02:15:22,084 --> 02:15:23,948
And he will strike hard.

1320
02:15:24,386 --> 02:15:28,482
He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.

1321
02:15:42,369 --> 02:15:44,599
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

1322
02:15:44,772 --> 02:15:47,502
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

1323
02:15:47,675 --> 02:15:49,939
Well, if you're not spies, then who are you?

1324
02:15:56,817 --> 02:15:58,546
Speak.

1325
02:15:59,652 --> 02:16:02,246
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

1326
02:16:02,589 --> 02:16:05,616
Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise Gamgee.

1327
02:16:06,060 --> 02:16:07,550
Your bodyguard?

1328
02:16:07,762 --> 02:16:09,525
His gardener.

1329
02:16:10,164 --> 02:16:12,132
And where is your skulking friend?

1330
02:16:13,667 --> 02:16:15,965
That gangrel creature.

1331
02:16:16,303 --> 02:16:18,270
He had an ill-favored look.

1332
02:16:20,006 --> 02:16:21,906
There was no other.

1333
02:16:26,012 --> 02:16:28,345
We set out from Rivendell with seven companions.

1334
02:16:31,684 --> 02:16:34,744
One we lost in Moria...

1335
02:16:35,822 --> 02:16:37,346
two were my kin...

1336
02:16:37,524 --> 02:16:41,255
a Dwarf there was also. And an Elf and two Men.

1337
02:16:41,461 --> 02:16:45,363
Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.

1338
02:16:50,370 --> 02:16:52,133
You're a friend of Boromir?

1339
02:16:54,574 --> 02:16:56,064
Yes.

1340
02:16:57,143 --> 02:16:58,235
For my part.

1341
02:17:04,750 --> 02:17:07,685
It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead.

1342
02:17:09,721 --> 02:17:11,189
Dead?

1343
02:17:11,391 --> 02:17:13,415
How? When?

1344
02:17:13,692 --> 02:17:16,319
As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me.

1345
02:17:16,661 --> 02:17:20,496
If something has happened to
Boromir, we would have you tell us.

1346
02:17:23,236 --> 02:17:29,697
His horn washed up upon the
riverbank, about six days past.

1347
02:17:29,908 --> 02:17:33,002
It was cloven in two.

1348
02:17:34,612 --> 02:17:38,013
But more than this, I know it in my heart.

1349
02:17:40,052 --> 02:17:41,849
He was my brother.

1350
02:18:31,300 --> 02:18:33,770
Boromir!

1351
02:18:34,304 --> 02:18:36,170
Boromir!

1352
02:18:40,410 --> 02:18:44,176
This city was once the jewel of our kingdom.

1353
02:18:44,347 --> 02:18:48,010
A place of light and beauty and music.

1354
02:18:48,184 --> 02:18:50,516
And so it shall be once more!

1355
02:18:53,090 --> 02:18:55,718
Let the armies of Mordor know this:

1356
02:18:55,927 --> 02:19:00,294
Never again will the land of
my people fall into enemy hands.

1357
02:19:04,100 --> 02:19:09,766
This city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed for Gondor!

1358
02:19:10,140 --> 02:19:12,107
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1359
02:19:12,274 --> 02:19:15,107
- For Gondor!
- For Gondor!

1360
02:19:23,819 --> 02:19:26,584
Good speech. Nice and short.

1361
02:19:26,790 --> 02:19:29,690
Leaves more time for drinking!

1362
02:19:29,992 --> 02:19:34,190
Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!

1363
02:19:37,634 --> 02:19:39,795
Remember today, little brother.

1364
02:19:39,969 --> 02:19:42,961
Today, life is good.

1365
02:19:47,142 --> 02:19:48,734
What?

1366
02:19:49,111 --> 02:19:50,578
He's here.

1367
02:19:53,782 --> 02:19:55,614
One moment of peace, can he not give us that?

1368
02:19:55,784 --> 02:19:56,807
Where is he?

1369
02:19:56,985 --> 02:20:00,443
Where is Gondor's finest? Where's my first-born?

1370
02:20:01,022 --> 02:20:02,717
Father!

1371
02:20:07,596 --> 02:20:09,962
They say you vanquished the
enemy almost single-handedly.

1372
02:20:10,132 --> 02:20:13,532
They exaggerate. The victory belongs to Faramir also.

1373
02:20:15,003 --> 02:20:17,904
But for Faramir, this city would still be standing.

1374
02:20:18,706 --> 02:20:21,004
Were you not entrusted to protect it?

1375
02:20:21,176 --> 02:20:23,201
I would have done, but our numbers were too few.

1376
02:20:23,378 --> 02:20:25,073
Oh, too few.

1377
02:20:25,581 --> 02:20:27,980
You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim.

1378
02:20:30,183 --> 02:20:33,176
Always you cast a poor reflection on me.

1379
02:20:33,388 --> 02:20:35,617
That is not my intent.

1380
02:20:35,823 --> 02:20:39,589
You give him no credit, and
yet he tries to do your will.

1381
02:20:42,963 --> 02:20:45,864
- He loves you, Father.
- Do not trouble me with Faramir...

1382
02:20:46,034 --> 02:20:48,797
I know his uses, and they are few.

1383
02:20:48,970 --> 02:20:52,564
We have more urgent things to speak of.

1384
02:20:53,741 --> 02:20:56,174
Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.

1385
02:20:56,343 --> 02:20:59,210
He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose.

1386
02:20:59,379 --> 02:21:03,179
It is rumored that the weapon
of the enemy has been found.

1387
02:21:05,419 --> 02:21:07,683
The One Ring.

1388
02:21:10,458 --> 02:21:15,121
- Isildur's Bane.
- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.

1389
02:21:15,294 --> 02:21:18,924
Everyone will try to claim it: Men, Dwarves, wizards.

1390
02:21:19,099 --> 02:21:23,229
We cannot let that happen.
This thing must come to Gondor.

1391
02:21:25,039 --> 02:21:27,699
- Gondor.
- It's dangerous, I know.

1392
02:21:27,874 --> 02:21:31,570
Ever the Ring will seek to
corrupt the hearts of lesser Men.

1393
02:21:31,744 --> 02:21:35,647
But you, you are strong. And our need is great.

1394
02:21:35,816 --> 02:21:41,117
It is our blood which is being
spilled, our people who are dying.

1395
02:21:41,320 --> 02:21:46,348
Sauron is biding his time. He's massing fresh armies.

1396
02:21:46,559 --> 02:21:48,026
He will return.

1397
02:21:48,227 --> 02:21:51,959
And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him.

1398
02:21:52,131 --> 02:21:54,692
You must go.

1399
02:21:55,867 --> 02:21:57,961
Bring me back this mighty gift.

1400
02:21:58,803 --> 02:22:04,299
No. My place is here with my people. Not in Rivendell.

1401
02:22:04,477 --> 02:22:08,174
- Would you deny your own father?
- If there is need to go to Rivendell...

1402
02:22:08,347 --> 02:22:11,315
- send me in his stead.
- You?

1403
02:22:12,518 --> 02:22:14,452
Oh, I see.

1404
02:22:14,619 --> 02:22:18,817
A chance for Faramir, captain
of Gondor, to show his quality.

1405
02:22:19,257 --> 02:22:21,226
I think not.

1406
02:22:21,426 --> 02:22:24,294
I trust this mission only to your brother.

1407
02:22:24,463 --> 02:22:27,363
The one who will not fail me.

1408
02:22:44,449 --> 02:22:47,612
Remember today, little brother.

1409
02:23:06,004 --> 02:23:07,994
Captain Faramir!

1410
02:23:09,274 --> 02:23:11,400
We found the third one.

1411
02:23:22,920 --> 02:23:24,888
You must come with me. Now.

1412
02:23:36,099 --> 02:23:37,191
Down there.

1413
02:23:52,115 --> 02:23:55,015
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.

1414
02:24:05,628 --> 02:24:07,118
They wait for my command.

1415
02:24:12,602 --> 02:24:13,694
Shall I shoot?

1416
02:24:14,937 --> 02:24:17,963
The rock and pool Is nice and cool

1417
02:24:18,140 --> 02:24:19,971
So juicy sweet

1418
02:24:20,610 --> 02:24:23,579
Our only wish To catch a fish

1419
02:24:23,747 --> 02:24:26,441
So juicy sweet

1420
02:24:33,422 --> 02:24:34,820
Wait.

1421
02:24:36,325 --> 02:24:39,157
This creature is bound to me.

1422
02:24:39,761 --> 02:24:41,695
And I to him.

1423
02:24:44,966 --> 02:24:46,264
He is our guide.

1424
02:24:51,007 --> 02:24:52,406
Please...

1425
02:24:52,575 --> 02:24:54,439
let me go down to him.

1426
02:25:05,754 --> 02:25:07,415
Smeagol.

1427
02:25:08,423 --> 02:25:10,652
Master is here.

1428
02:25:11,859 --> 02:25:12,985
Come, Smeagol.

1429
02:25:15,864 --> 02:25:18,492
Trust master. Come.

1430
02:25:21,670 --> 02:25:25,503
We must go now?

1431
02:25:25,873 --> 02:25:29,310
Smeagol, you must trust master.

1432
02:25:29,476 --> 02:25:30,875
Follow me. Come on.

1433
02:25:32,112 --> 02:25:33,602
Come.

1434
02:25:36,151 --> 02:25:37,310
Come, Smeagol.

1435
02:25:37,852 --> 02:25:39,876
Nice Smeagol. That's it.

1436
02:25:40,421 --> 02:25:41,911
Come on.

1437
02:25:46,360 --> 02:25:48,021
Don't hurt him!

1438
02:25:48,196 --> 02:25:50,925
Smeagol, don't struggle. Smeagol, listen to me.

1439
02:25:51,098 --> 02:25:52,396
Master!

1440
02:26:36,817 --> 02:26:41,584
Why does it cry, Smeagol?

1441
02:26:42,856 --> 02:26:45,450
Cruel Men hurts us.

1442
02:26:45,659 --> 02:26:48,628
Master tricksed us.

1443
02:26:48,829 --> 02:26:52,390
Of course he did.

1444
02:26:52,766 --> 02:26:56,463
I told you he was tricksy.

1445
02:26:56,636 --> 02:26:59,662
I told you he was false.

1446
02:26:59,840 --> 02:27:02,536
Master is our friend.

1447
02:27:02,709 --> 02:27:05,075
Our friend.

1448
02:27:05,245 --> 02:27:07,406
Master betrayed us.

1449
02:27:07,581 --> 02:27:10,573
No. Not its business.

1450
02:27:11,651 --> 02:27:14,119
Leave us alone!

1451
02:27:14,287 --> 02:27:16,687
Filthy little Hobbitses!

1452
02:27:16,857 --> 02:27:19,155
They stole it from us!

1453
02:27:19,326 --> 02:27:20,759
No. No.

1454
02:27:21,328 --> 02:27:22,955
What did they steal?

1455
02:27:25,098 --> 02:27:30,434
My precious!

1456
02:27:34,074 --> 02:27:35,701
We have to get out of here.

1457
02:27:36,309 --> 02:27:38,277
You go. Go, now.

1458
02:27:40,881 --> 02:27:42,746
You can do it.

1459
02:27:44,184 --> 02:27:45,651
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

1460
02:27:45,852 --> 02:27:47,615
Just this once.

1461
02:27:47,821 --> 02:27:49,550
Put it on.

1462
02:27:50,023 --> 02:27:52,014
Disappear.

1463
02:27:53,093 --> 02:27:54,151
I can't.

1464
02:27:57,264 --> 02:27:59,494
You were right, Sam.

1465
02:28:00,934 --> 02:28:03,425
You tried to tell me but...

1466
02:28:08,141 --> 02:28:10,302
I'm sorry.

1467
02:28:14,848 --> 02:28:17,715
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

1468
02:28:19,152 --> 02:28:20,779
If I put it on...

1469
02:28:20,987 --> 02:28:23,319
he'll find me.

1470
02:28:24,991 --> 02:28:26,959
He'll see.

1471
02:28:28,194 --> 02:28:30,162
Mr. Frodo...

1472
02:28:35,035 --> 02:28:39,301
So this is the answer to all the riddles.

1473
02:28:41,508 --> 02:28:44,500
Here in the Wild I have you...

1474
02:28:44,678 --> 02:28:46,578
two Halflings...

1475
02:28:46,746 --> 02:28:49,909
and a host of men at my call.

1476
02:28:53,253 --> 02:28:56,711
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

1477
02:29:06,433 --> 02:29:10,164
A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor...

1478
02:29:11,771 --> 02:29:14,797
to show his quality.

1479
02:29:35,895 --> 02:29:37,487
No!

1480
02:29:40,667 --> 02:29:41,998
Stop it!

1481
02:29:42,168 --> 02:29:43,226
Leave him alone.

1482
02:29:44,571 --> 02:29:47,062
Don't you understand?

1483
02:29:48,375 --> 02:29:50,275
He's got to destroy it!

1484
02:29:50,443 --> 02:29:53,674
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

1485
02:29:53,847 --> 02:29:55,508
To the Mountain of Fire!

1486
02:29:56,583 --> 02:29:59,677
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1487
02:29:59,886 --> 02:30:02,855
Please. It's such a burden.

1488
02:30:05,058 --> 02:30:07,117
Will you not help him?

1489
02:30:08,495 --> 02:30:10,395
Captain?

1490
02:30:11,064 --> 02:30:13,294
Prepare to leave.

1491
02:30:18,238 --> 02:30:20,672
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1492
02:31:20,925 --> 02:31:24,350
Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nîn.
(Well done, Brego, my friend.)

1493
02:31:33,613 --> 02:31:36,241
- He's alive!
- Where is he? Where is he?

1494
02:31:36,416 --> 02:31:39,476
Get out of the way! I'm going to kill him!

1495
02:31:39,686 --> 02:31:43,417
You are the luckiest, the canniest...

1496
02:31:43,623 --> 02:31:47,616
and the most reckless man I ever knew.

1497
02:31:48,328 --> 02:31:49,795
Bless you, laddie.

1498
02:31:50,396 --> 02:31:52,125
Gimli, where is the king?

1499
02:32:00,920 --> 02:32:02,100
Le abdollen.
(You're late.)

1500
02:32:05,912 --> 02:32:07,243
You look terrible.

1501
02:32:34,370 --> 02:32:35,800
Hannon le.
(Thank you.)

1502
02:32:48,988 --> 02:32:51,013
A great host, you say?

1503
02:32:51,224 --> 02:32:53,886
- All Isengard is emptied.
- How many?

1504
02:32:54,561 --> 02:32:57,553
Ten thousand strong at least.

1505
02:32:59,098 --> 02:33:00,531
Ten thousand?

1506
02:33:00,967 --> 02:33:03,458
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1507
02:33:06,139 --> 02:33:08,266
To destroy the world of Men.

1508
02:33:10,777 --> 02:33:12,768
They will be here by nightfall.

1509
02:33:18,618 --> 02:33:19,915
Let them come!

1510
02:33:21,454 --> 02:33:24,184
I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms...

1511
02:33:24,390 --> 02:33:27,518
to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1512
02:33:35,702 --> 02:33:38,637
We will cover the causeway and the gate from above.

1513
02:33:38,805 --> 02:33:41,239
No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall...

1514
02:33:41,407 --> 02:33:44,137
or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1515
02:33:44,310 --> 02:33:46,710
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1516
02:33:47,313 --> 02:33:49,508
These are Uruk-hai.

1517
02:33:49,682 --> 02:33:53,118
Their armor is thick and their shields broad.

1518
02:33:54,787 --> 02:33:58,416
I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.

1519
02:33:58,625 --> 02:34:02,220
I know how to defend my own keep.

1520
02:34:08,835 --> 02:34:12,236
They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.

1521
02:34:12,405 --> 02:34:17,638
Saruman's hordes will pillage
and burn. We've seen it before.

1522
02:34:17,844 --> 02:34:20,506
Crops can be resown...

1523
02:34:20,680 --> 02:34:23,672
homes rebuilt.

1524
02:34:24,284 --> 02:34:26,844
Within these walls...

1525
02:34:27,253 --> 02:34:28,720
we will outlast them.

1526
02:34:28,922 --> 02:34:31,322
They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages.

1527
02:34:31,491 --> 02:34:33,015
They come to destroy its people...

1528
02:34:33,159 --> 02:34:35,627
down to the last child.

1529
02:34:36,529 --> 02:34:38,793
What would you have me do?

1530
02:34:38,965 --> 02:34:40,694
Look at my men.

1531
02:34:40,867 --> 02:34:42,596
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1532
02:34:44,804 --> 02:34:49,207
If this is to be our end, then I
would have them make such an end...

1533
02:34:49,375 --> 02:34:52,401
as to be worthy of remembrance.

1534
02:34:56,049 --> 02:34:57,949
Send out riders, my lord.

1535
02:34:58,251 --> 02:35:01,118
You must call for aid.

1536
02:35:04,424 --> 02:35:06,688
And who will come?

1537
02:35:07,093 --> 02:35:08,685
Elves?

1538
02:35:08,861 --> 02:35:10,920
Dwarves?

1539
02:35:11,698 --> 02:35:14,565
We are not so lucky in our friends as you.

1540
02:35:15,401 --> 02:35:17,665
The old alliances are dead.

1541
02:35:18,104 --> 02:35:20,902
- Gondor will answer.
- Gondor?!

1542
02:35:21,074 --> 02:35:23,269
Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?!

1543
02:35:24,243 --> 02:35:27,474
Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us?!

1544
02:35:27,647 --> 02:35:29,581
Where was Gon...?

1545
02:35:32,251 --> 02:35:34,151
No, my Lord Aragorn...

1546
02:35:35,755 --> 02:35:38,223
we are alone.

1547
02:35:45,098 --> 02:35:46,827
Get the women and children into the caves.

1548
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:48,262
We need more time to lay provisions...

1549
02:35:48,434 --> 02:35:51,926
There is no time. War is upon us.

1550
02:35:52,205 --> 02:35:53,900
Secure the gate.

1551
02:35:59,112 --> 02:36:01,205
We Ents have not troubled...

1552
02:36:01,414 --> 02:36:04,781
about the wars of Men and wizards...

1553
02:36:05,551 --> 02:36:08,543
for a very long time.

1554
02:36:09,822 --> 02:36:14,589
But now, something is about to happen...

1555
02:36:14,761 --> 02:36:17,093
that has not happened...

1556
02:36:17,296 --> 02:36:19,764
for an age.

1557
02:36:20,967 --> 02:36:23,231
Entmoot.

1558
02:36:23,669 --> 02:36:24,658
What's that?

1559
02:36:25,071 --> 02:36:27,904
'Tis a gathering.

1560
02:36:29,108 --> 02:36:31,668
A gathering of what?

1561
02:36:49,629 --> 02:36:51,995
Beech. Oak.

1562
02:36:52,165 --> 02:36:54,065
Chestnut. Ash.

1563
02:36:54,333 --> 02:36:56,301
Good. Good. Good.

1564
02:36:56,469 --> 02:36:58,835
Many have come.

1565
02:37:06,379 --> 02:37:09,143
Now we must decide if the Ents...

1566
02:37:09,315 --> 02:37:11,875
will go to war.

1567
02:37:20,860 --> 02:37:23,920
Move back! Move to the caves!

1568
02:37:26,399 --> 02:37:28,458
Come on, people! Quickly, now!

1569
02:37:28,868 --> 02:37:31,166
We'll place the reserves along the wall.

1570
02:37:31,337 --> 02:37:33,567
They can support the archers from above the gate.

1571
02:37:33,739 --> 02:37:36,867
Aragorn, you must rest.

1572
02:37:37,043 --> 02:37:39,443
You're no use to us half alive.

1573
02:37:39,912 --> 02:37:41,106
Aragorn!

1574
02:37:44,517 --> 02:37:47,543
I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.

1575
02:37:47,753 --> 02:37:49,380
That is an honorable charge.

1576
02:37:49,589 --> 02:37:52,456
To mind the children, to find food
and bedding when the men return.

1577
02:37:52,625 --> 02:37:54,320
What renown is there in that?

1578
02:37:54,494 --> 02:37:58,191
My lady, a time may come for valor without renown.

1579
02:37:58,464 --> 02:38:01,262
Who then will your people look to in the last defense?

1580
02:38:01,434 --> 02:38:06,428
- Let me stand at your side.
- It is not in my power to command it.

1581
02:38:06,739 --> 02:38:09,537
You do not command the others to stay!

1582
02:38:09,709 --> 02:38:13,475
They fight beside you because
they would not be parted from you.

1583
02:38:14,647 --> 02:38:16,842
Because they love you.

1584
02:38:23,990 --> 02:38:25,480
I'm sorry.

1585
02:39:31,424 --> 02:39:34,655
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1586
02:39:35,728 --> 02:39:37,525
These are no soldiers.

1587
02:39:39,799 --> 02:39:43,257
- Most have seen too many winters.
- Or too few.

1588
02:39:47,206 --> 02:39:50,107
Look at them. They're frightened.

1589
02:39:50,276 --> 02:39:51,743
I can see it in their eyes.

1590
02:39:56,370 --> 02:39:57,600
Boe a hyn
(And they should be)

1591
02:39:58,920 --> 02:40:00,200
Neled herain...
(Three Hundred...)

1592
02:40:00,600 --> 02:40:01,520
...dan caer menig
(...against Ten Thousand)

1593
02:40:03,750 --> 02:40:05,850
Si beriathar hyn ammaeg na ned Edoras.
(They have more hope of defending themselves here than at Edoras)

1594
02:40:05,900 --> 02:40:10,200
Aragorn nedin dagor hen ú-'erir ortheri.
(Aragorn, they cannot win this fight.)

1595
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:12,400
Natha daged dhaer.
(They are all going to die!)

1596
02:40:12,732 --> 02:40:14,927
Then I shall die as one of them!

1597
02:40:21,374 --> 02:40:23,205
Let him go, lad.

1598
02:40:23,776 --> 02:40:25,744
Let him be.

1599
02:40:27,213 --> 02:40:32,674
Every villager able to wield a
sword has been sent to the armory.

1600
02:40:36,922 --> 02:40:38,822
My lord?

1601
02:40:40,893 --> 02:40:43,453
Who am I, Gamling?

1602
02:40:46,832 --> 02:40:50,734
You are our king, sire.

1603
02:40:53,739 --> 02:40:57,004
And do you trust your king?

1604
02:40:58,544 --> 02:41:01,707
Your men, my lord...

1605
02:41:01,881 --> 02:41:04,679
will follow you to whatever end.

1606
02:41:11,590 --> 02:41:13,490
To whatever end.

1607
02:41:23,336 --> 02:41:26,897
Where is the horse and the rider?

1608
02:41:27,073 --> 02:41:30,133
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1609
02:41:31,644 --> 02:41:36,013
They have passed like rain on the mountains.

1610
02:41:37,016 --> 02:41:40,247
Like wind in the meadow.

1611
02:41:43,956 --> 02:41:47,722
The days have gone down in the West...

1612
02:41:48,427 --> 02:41:51,055
behind the hills...

1613
02:41:52,965 --> 02:41:54,592
into Shadow.

1614
02:42:03,042 --> 02:42:06,478
How did it come to this?

1615
02:42:27,800 --> 02:42:29,665
It's been going for hours.

1616
02:42:30,803 --> 02:42:33,169
They must have decided something by now.

1617
02:42:33,339 --> 02:42:37,435
Decided? No.

1618
02:42:37,610 --> 02:42:42,741
We only just finished saying...

1619
02:42:43,949 --> 02:42:45,814
good morning.

1620
02:42:47,186 --> 02:42:50,349
But it's nighttime already.

1621
02:42:50,556 --> 02:42:52,353
You can't take forever.

1622
02:42:53,359 --> 02:42:55,384
Don't be hasty.

1623
02:42:55,861 --> 02:42:58,261
We're running out of time!

1624
02:43:01,267 --> 02:43:04,236
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1625
02:43:21,821 --> 02:43:23,118
Give me your sword.

1626
02:43:32,631 --> 02:43:33,757
What is your name?

1627
02:43:34,300 --> 02:43:36,666
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.

1628
02:43:38,804 --> 02:43:41,432
The men are saying we will not live out the night.

1629
02:43:43,409 --> 02:43:45,377
They say that it is hopeless.

1630
02:44:03,229 --> 02:44:04,856
This is a good sword.

1631
02:44:06,899 --> 02:44:09,231
Haleth, son of Hama...

1632
02:44:13,572 --> 02:44:15,733
there is always hope.

1633
02:44:38,664 --> 02:44:42,031
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1634
02:44:42,201 --> 02:44:43,759
Forgive me.

1635
02:44:43,936 --> 02:44:45,369
I was wrong to despair.

1636
02:44:48,300 --> 02:44:50,650
Ú-moe edhored, Legolas.
(There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.)

1637
02:44:54,580 --> 02:44:57,378
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1638
02:45:00,853 --> 02:45:02,878
It's a little tight across the chest.

1639
02:45:09,094 --> 02:45:11,062
That is no Orc horn.

1640
02:45:16,735 --> 02:45:18,566
Send for the king.

1641
02:45:18,737 --> 02:45:22,332
- Open the gate!
- Open up the gate!

1642
02:45:53,973 --> 02:45:55,634
How is this possible?

1643
02:45:56,642 --> 02:46:00,271
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1644
02:46:00,446 --> 02:46:03,677
An alliance once existed between Elves and Men.

1645
02:46:04,383 --> 02:46:08,615
Long ago we fought and died together.

1646
02:46:10,923 --> 02:46:13,600
We come to honor that allegiance.

1647
02:46:13,800 --> 02:46:15,600
Mae govannen, Haldir!
(Well met, Haldir!)

1648
02:46:22,301 --> 02:46:24,235
You are most welcome.

1649
02:46:29,608 --> 02:46:33,544
We are proud to fight alongside Men once more.

1650
02:47:07,212 --> 02:47:10,477
You could have picked a better spot.

1651
02:47:15,387 --> 02:47:19,551
Well, lad, whatever luck you live
by, let's hope it lasts the night.

1652
02:47:25,731 --> 02:47:27,528
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1653
02:47:28,167 --> 02:47:30,658
Let's hope they last the night.

1654
02:48:30,700 --> 02:48:31,800
A Eruchîn...
(O, Children of Eru...)

1655
02:48:32,100 --> 02:48:33,800
...ú-dano i faelas a hyn...
(...show them no mercy...)

1656
02:48:34,750 --> 02:48:37,500
...an uben tanatha le faelas.
(...for you shall receive none!)

1657
02:49:12,070 --> 02:49:14,868
- What's happening out there?
- Shall I describe it to you?

1658
02:49:16,141 --> 02:49:17,938
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1659
02:49:57,025 --> 02:49:57,850
Dartho!
(Hold!)

1660
02:50:21,139 --> 02:50:22,936
So it begins.

1661
02:50:28,400 --> 02:50:30,200
Tangado a chadad!
(Prepare to fire!)

1662
02:50:38,100 --> 02:50:38,950
Faeg i-varv...
(Their armour is weak...)

1663
02:50:40,350 --> 02:50:41,250
...dîn na lanc...
(...at the throat...)

1664
02:50:41,850 --> 02:50:42,550
...a nu ranc.
(...and beneath the arm.)

1665
02:50:42,750 --> 02:50:44,750
Leithio i philinn!
(Fire the arrows!)

1666
02:50:49,768 --> 02:50:51,133
Did they hit anything?

1667
02:50:51,803 --> 02:50:53,794
Give them a volley.

1668
02:50:53,972 --> 02:50:56,065
- Fire!
- Fire!

1669
02:51:11,823 --> 02:51:13,518
Send them to me! Come on!

1670
02:51:32,500 --> 02:51:33,900
Pendraith!
(Ladders!)

1671
02:51:34,212 --> 02:51:35,304
Good!

1672
02:51:42,120 --> 02:51:45,089
Swords! Swords!

1673
02:52:23,228 --> 02:52:25,355
Legolas! Two already!

1674
02:52:25,530 --> 02:52:27,657
I'm on 17!

1675
02:52:27,833 --> 02:52:30,393
I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!

1676
02:52:37,142 --> 02:52:38,871
Nineteen!

1677
02:53:04,870 --> 02:53:06,303
Merry.

1678
02:53:10,709 --> 02:53:14,509
We have just agreed.

1679
02:53:24,556 --> 02:53:26,023
Yes?

1680
02:53:27,526 --> 02:53:31,690
I have told your names to the Entmoot...

1681
02:53:32,831 --> 02:53:35,994
and we have agreed...

1682
02:53:36,468 --> 02:53:40,495
you are not Orcs.

1683
02:53:42,240 --> 02:53:44,367
Well, that's good news.

1684
02:53:44,543 --> 02:53:48,673
And what about Saruman? Have
you come to a decision about him?

1685
02:53:49,314 --> 02:53:53,114
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1686
02:53:53,285 --> 02:53:54,809
Hasty?

1687
02:53:55,620 --> 02:53:57,520
Our friends are out there.

1688
02:53:57,689 --> 02:54:01,853
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1689
02:54:02,194 --> 02:54:04,458
War? Yes.

1690
02:54:04,629 --> 02:54:06,529
It affects us all.

1691
02:54:06,698 --> 02:54:09,690
Tree, root and twig.

1692
02:54:10,569 --> 02:54:14,596
But you must understand, young Hobbit...

1693
02:54:14,806 --> 02:54:16,740
it takes a long time...

1694
02:54:16,908 --> 02:54:21,811
to say anything in Old Entish...

1695
02:54:21,980 --> 02:54:26,212
and we never say anything...

1696
02:54:26,384 --> 02:54:30,320
unless it is worth taking...

1697
02:54:30,489 --> 02:54:34,448
a long time to say.

1698
02:54:35,260 --> 02:54:38,559
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1699
02:54:38,730 --> 02:54:39,788
Nineteen!

1700
02:54:40,365 --> 02:54:42,230
Twenty!

1701
02:54:42,400 --> 02:54:44,061
Twenty-one!

1702
02:54:54,146 --> 02:54:55,137
Causeway!

1703
02:54:55,250 --> 02:54:57,550
Towards the causeway!

1704
02:55:03,955 --> 02:55:06,321
Is this it?

1705
02:55:06,491 --> 02:55:09,426
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?

1706
02:55:35,500 --> 02:55:37,250
Togo han dad, Legolas!
(Bring him down, Legolas!)

1707
02:55:40,050 --> 02:55:41,250
Dago hon!
(Kill him!)

1708
02:55:41,600 --> 02:55:42,750
Dago hon!
(Kill him!)

1709
02:56:35,413 --> 02:56:36,778
Brace the gate!

1710
02:56:55,133 --> 02:56:57,397
Hold them! Stand firm!

1711
02:57:05,277 --> 02:57:06,608
Aragorn!

1712
02:57:11,249 --> 02:57:12,443
Gimli!

1713
02:57:18,550 --> 02:57:20,000
Hado i philinn!
(Hurl the arrows!)

1714
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:24,800
Herio!
(Charge!)

1715
02:58:01,199 --> 02:58:05,135
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1716
02:58:05,904 --> 02:58:09,931
We must weather such things as we have always done.

1717
02:58:10,742 --> 02:58:12,835
How can that be your decision?!

1718
02:58:13,511 --> 02:58:17,140
This is not our war.

1719
02:58:17,449 --> 02:58:19,644
But you're part of this world!

1720
02:58:23,822 --> 02:58:25,653
Aren't you?!

1721
02:58:29,728 --> 02:58:32,094
You must help. Please.

1722
02:58:33,331 --> 02:58:36,095
You must do something.

1723
02:58:36,368 --> 02:58:40,668
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1724
02:58:41,873 --> 02:58:45,604
But your part in this tale is over.

1725
02:58:45,777 --> 02:58:48,007
Go back to your home.

1726
02:58:58,056 --> 02:59:00,320
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1727
02:59:00,492 --> 02:59:02,357
We don't belong here, Merry.

1728
02:59:02,527 --> 02:59:04,791
It's too big for us.

1729
02:59:04,963 --> 02:59:07,625
What can we do in the end?

1730
02:59:09,934 --> 02:59:12,562
We've got the Shire.

1731
02:59:13,104 --> 02:59:15,629
Maybe we should go home.

1732
02:59:17,475 --> 02:59:20,706
The fires of Isengard will spread...

1733
02:59:20,879 --> 02:59:25,782
and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.

1734
02:59:25,950 --> 02:59:27,542
And...

1735
02:59:29,387 --> 02:59:32,413
And all that was once green and
good in this world will be gone.

1736
02:59:35,927 --> 02:59:38,862
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1737
02:59:58,383 --> 02:59:59,611
Aragorn!

1738
02:59:59,784 --> 03:00:02,150
Fall back to the Keep!

1739
03:00:02,353 --> 03:00:05,413
Get your men out of there!

1740
03:00:06,550 --> 03:00:08,000
Am Marad!
(To the Keep!)

1741
03:00:12,500 --> 03:00:13,750
Nan Barad!
(Pull back!)

1742
03:00:15,099 --> 03:00:16,760
Haldir!

1743
03:00:17,550 --> 03:00:18,900
Nan Barad!
(Pull back!)

1744
03:00:20,872 --> 03:00:24,137
What are you doing? What are you stopping for?

1745
03:00:24,750 --> 03:00:25,950
Nan Barad!
(Pull back!)

1746
03:00:43,328 --> 03:00:44,556
Haldir!

1747
03:01:27,272 --> 03:01:28,762
Brace the gate!

1748
03:01:31,009 --> 03:01:32,306
Hold them!

1749
03:01:34,078 --> 03:01:37,445
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1750
03:02:05,610 --> 03:02:07,544
Make way!

1751
03:02:10,448 --> 03:02:12,177
We cannot hold much longer!

1752
03:02:18,189 --> 03:02:21,716
- Hold them!
- How long do you need?

1753
03:02:21,926 --> 03:02:24,486
As long as you can give me.

1754
03:02:24,662 --> 03:02:26,323
Gimli!

1755
03:02:27,799 --> 03:02:29,164
Timbers!

1756
03:02:29,334 --> 03:02:31,302
Brace the gate!

1757
03:02:46,017 --> 03:02:47,712
Come on. We can take them.

1758
03:02:48,586 --> 03:02:50,178
It's a long way.

1759
03:02:55,460 --> 03:02:57,223
Toss me.

1760
03:02:58,396 --> 03:03:00,227
- What?
- I cannot jump the distance!

1761
03:03:00,398 --> 03:03:01,956
You'll have to toss me!

1762
03:03:07,572 --> 03:03:08,834
Don't tell the Elf.

1763
03:03:09,374 --> 03:03:11,137
Not a word.

1764
03:03:26,424 --> 03:03:27,857
Shore up the door!

1765
03:03:28,026 --> 03:03:30,119
- Make way!
- Follow me to the barricade.

1766
03:03:30,294 --> 03:03:31,352
Watch our backs!

1767
03:03:35,433 --> 03:03:37,663
- Throw another one over here!
- Higher!

1768
03:04:27,652 --> 03:04:29,051
Hold fast the gate!

1769
03:04:33,257 --> 03:04:36,192
Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there!

1770
03:04:40,932 --> 03:04:42,524
Aragorn!

1771
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:18,434
Pull everybody back.

1772
03:05:18,803 --> 03:05:20,600
Pull them back.

1773
03:05:21,139 --> 03:05:22,606
Fall back!

1774
03:05:22,774 --> 03:05:25,265
Fall back!

1775
03:05:26,444 --> 03:05:28,139
They have broken through!

1776
03:05:28,312 --> 03:05:30,576
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1777
03:05:30,748 --> 03:05:32,978
- Fall back!
- Retreat!

1778
03:05:33,084 --> 03:05:35,678
Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!

1779
03:05:35,887 --> 03:05:38,117
Into the Keep!

1780
03:05:49,600 --> 03:05:54,560
I will leave you at the western borders of the forest.

1781
03:05:54,739 --> 03:05:59,438
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1782
03:06:05,183 --> 03:06:06,445
Wait! Stop!

1783
03:06:07,351 --> 03:06:08,841
Stop!

1784
03:06:11,989 --> 03:06:13,684
Turn around.

1785
03:06:14,625 --> 03:06:17,321
- Turn around. Take us south.
- South?

1786
03:06:17,495 --> 03:06:22,489
But that will lead you past Isengard.

1787
03:06:22,834 --> 03:06:25,530
Yes. Exactly.

1788
03:06:25,703 --> 03:06:28,934
If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed.

1789
03:06:29,106 --> 03:06:31,768
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

1790
03:06:31,943 --> 03:06:33,934
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1791
03:06:36,547 --> 03:06:39,573
That doesn't make sense to me.

1792
03:06:39,750 --> 03:06:40,910
But then...

1793
03:06:41,118 --> 03:06:43,780
you are very small.

1794
03:06:44,288 --> 03:06:46,017
Perhaps you're right.

1795
03:06:48,693 --> 03:06:50,183
South it is, then.

1796
03:06:51,729 --> 03:06:55,062
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1797
03:06:57,101 --> 03:06:59,865
I always like going south.

1798
03:07:00,037 --> 03:07:04,337
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1799
03:07:04,942 --> 03:07:07,410
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1800
03:07:07,578 --> 03:07:09,512
No, we won't.

1801
03:07:10,248 --> 03:07:12,512
Not this time.

1802
03:07:19,190 --> 03:07:20,179
Look!

1803
03:07:21,859 --> 03:07:24,293
Osgiliath burns!

1804
03:07:24,462 --> 03:07:25,895
Mordor has come.

1805
03:07:27,031 --> 03:07:29,431
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1806
03:07:30,768 --> 03:07:32,963
It has only the power to destroy.

1807
03:07:33,804 --> 03:07:35,237
Please...

1808
03:07:35,406 --> 03:07:37,033
let me go.

1809
03:07:38,075 --> 03:07:39,667
Hurry.

1810
03:07:43,147 --> 03:07:44,546
Faramir!

1811
03:07:44,715 --> 03:07:47,206
You must let me go!

1812
03:07:47,652 --> 03:07:51,110
And those little family of field mice...

1813
03:07:51,289 --> 03:07:54,122
that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.

1814
03:07:54,859 --> 03:07:58,158
They're always trying to get somewhere where they...

1815
03:08:09,340 --> 03:08:12,275
Many of these trees were my friends.

1816
03:08:12,977 --> 03:08:17,607
Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.

1817
03:08:18,783 --> 03:08:19,977
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1818
03:08:20,151 --> 03:08:22,915
They had voices of their own.

1819
03:08:25,189 --> 03:08:27,714
Saruman.

1820
03:08:28,092 --> 03:08:31,152
A wizard should know better!

1821
03:08:45,376 --> 03:08:49,005
There is no curse in Elvish...

1822
03:08:49,213 --> 03:08:51,875
Entish or the tongues of Men...

1823
03:08:52,049 --> 03:08:54,381
for this treachery.

1824
03:08:55,820 --> 03:08:58,653
Look! The trees! They're moving!

1825
03:09:03,361 --> 03:09:04,555
Where are they going?

1826
03:09:05,096 --> 03:09:08,327
They have business with the Orcs.

1827
03:09:08,799 --> 03:09:13,065
My business is with Isengard tonight...

1828
03:09:13,237 --> 03:09:15,865
with rock and stone.

1829
03:09:39,764 --> 03:09:40,890
Yes.

1830
03:09:41,999 --> 03:09:43,432
Come, my friends.

1831
03:09:44,769 --> 03:09:48,967
The Ents are going to war.

1832
03:09:49,140 --> 03:09:50,903
It is likely...

1833
03:09:51,075 --> 03:09:54,602
that we go to our doom.

1834
03:09:56,013 --> 03:09:58,481
Last march...

1835
03:09:59,016 --> 03:10:01,041
of the Ents.

1836
03:10:49,166 --> 03:10:52,897
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

1837
03:10:53,070 --> 03:10:55,129
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1838
03:10:57,908 --> 03:10:59,375
Mr. Frodo?

1839
03:10:59,677 --> 03:11:03,773
It's calling to him, Sam. His Eye is almost on me.

1840
03:11:03,948 --> 03:11:06,439
Hold on, Mr. Frodo. You'll be all right.

1841
03:11:20,798 --> 03:11:22,197
Take them to my father.

1842
03:11:23,767 --> 03:11:26,759
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1843
03:11:29,173 --> 03:11:32,199
A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.

1844
03:11:33,310 --> 03:11:36,006
Do you want to know what happened to Boromir?

1845
03:11:36,647 --> 03:11:39,411
You want to know why your brother died?

1846
03:11:39,917 --> 03:11:43,648
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1847
03:11:43,854 --> 03:11:45,754
He tried to kill him!

1848
03:11:45,923 --> 03:11:48,255
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1849
03:11:49,026 --> 03:11:50,891
Watch out!

1850
03:12:01,805 --> 03:12:02,931
Mr. Frodo?

1851
03:12:05,576 --> 03:12:07,407
They're here.

1852
03:12:10,514 --> 03:12:12,982
They've come.

1853
03:12:15,586 --> 03:12:17,486
Nazgul!

1854
03:12:39,543 --> 03:12:41,704
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1855
03:12:43,514 --> 03:12:45,744
Take cover!

1856
03:13:03,100 --> 03:13:04,658
The fortress is taken.

1857
03:13:05,436 --> 03:13:06,630
It is over.

1858
03:13:06,804 --> 03:13:10,740
You said this fortress would never
fall while your men defend it.

1859
03:13:10,908 --> 03:13:13,843
They still defend it. They have died defending it.

1860
03:13:16,580 --> 03:13:17,979
They're breaking in!

1861
03:13:20,618 --> 03:13:23,109
They're past the door!

1862
03:13:26,490 --> 03:13:30,620
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1863
03:13:33,230 --> 03:13:35,164
Is there no other way?

1864
03:13:36,734 --> 03:13:39,794
There is one passage. It leads into the mountains.

1865
03:13:40,471 --> 03:13:42,666
But they will not get far. The Uruk-hai are too many.

1866
03:13:47,544 --> 03:13:49,944
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1867
03:13:50,114 --> 03:13:52,981
- And barricade the entrance!
- So much death.

1868
03:13:55,185 --> 03:13:58,586
What can Men do against such reckless hate?

1869
03:14:03,260 --> 03:14:04,693
Ride out with me.

1870
03:14:08,799 --> 03:14:10,426
Ride out and meet them.

1871
03:14:11,201 --> 03:14:13,362
For death and glory.

1872
03:14:13,537 --> 03:14:14,936
For Rohan.

1873
03:14:16,440 --> 03:14:17,907
For your people.

1874
03:14:18,642 --> 03:14:20,576
The sun is rising.

1875
03:14:25,082 --> 03:14:28,074
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.

1876
03:14:28,252 --> 03:14:29,651
At dawn...

1877
03:14:29,853 --> 03:14:31,514
look to the east.

1878
03:14:35,693 --> 03:14:37,320
Yes.

1879
03:14:39,797 --> 03:14:41,458
Yes.

1880
03:14:42,800 --> 03:14:45,200
The horn of Helm Hammerhand...

1881
03:14:45,369 --> 03:14:48,167
shall sound in the Deep...

1882
03:14:48,605 --> 03:14:50,596
one last time.

1883
03:14:50,774 --> 03:14:52,264
Yes!

1884
03:14:55,312 --> 03:14:59,112
Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.

1885
03:15:06,924 --> 03:15:08,255
Fell deeds, awake.

1886
03:15:09,460 --> 03:15:10,518
Now for wrath...

1887
03:15:10,728 --> 03:15:14,129
now for ruin and a red dawn.

1888
03:15:21,171 --> 03:15:23,435
Forth Eorlingas!

1889
03:16:11,221 --> 03:16:12,415
Gandalf.

1890
03:16:19,730 --> 03:16:23,393
Theoden King stands alone.

1891
03:16:24,001 --> 03:16:26,162
Not alone.

1892
03:16:26,570 --> 03:16:27,696
Rohirrim!

1893
03:16:33,610 --> 03:16:34,770
Eomer.

1894
03:16:34,945 --> 03:16:37,470
To the king!

1895
03:17:55,125 --> 03:17:56,888
Yes!

1896
03:18:06,036 --> 03:18:09,472
A hit. A fine hit.

1897
03:18:33,997 --> 03:18:36,465
Break the dam!

1898
03:18:36,633 --> 03:18:40,069
Release the river!

1899
03:19:07,431 --> 03:19:10,161
Pippin! Hold on!

1900
03:19:15,439 --> 03:19:18,374
Hold on, little Hobbits.

1901
03:19:59,683 --> 03:20:01,708
What are you doing?

1902
03:20:10,327 --> 03:20:11,851
Where are you going?

1903
03:21:10,053 --> 03:21:11,350
It's me.

1904
03:21:13,890 --> 03:21:16,085
It's your Sam.

1905
03:21:20,430 --> 03:21:23,058
Don't you know your Sam?

1906
03:21:40,717 --> 03:21:44,084
I can't do this, Sam.

1907
03:21:45,021 --> 03:21:46,989
I know.

1908
03:21:48,024 --> 03:21:50,390
It's all wrong.

1909
03:21:51,128 --> 03:21:53,153
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1910
03:22:00,570 --> 03:22:02,663
But we are.

1911
03:22:09,079 --> 03:22:12,105
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1912
03:22:12,282 --> 03:22:14,682
The ones that really mattered.

1913
03:22:15,719 --> 03:22:18,711
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1914
03:22:18,922 --> 03:22:21,891
And sometimes you didn't want to know the end...

1915
03:22:22,058 --> 03:22:24,993
because how could the end be happy?

1916
03:22:27,564 --> 03:22:29,759
How could the world go back to the way it was...

1917
03:22:29,933 --> 03:22:33,369
when so much bad had happened?

1918
03:22:34,204 --> 03:22:36,104
Victory!

1919
03:22:36,273 --> 03:22:37,831
We have victory!

1920
03:22:38,008 --> 03:22:41,944
But in the end, it's only a passing thing...

1921
03:22:42,112 --> 03:22:43,443
this shadow.

1922
03:22:43,613 --> 03:22:46,013
Even darkness must pass.

1923
03:22:46,183 --> 03:22:48,879
A new day will come.

1924
03:22:49,085 --> 03:22:53,021
And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.

1925
03:22:54,958 --> 03:22:57,324
Those were the stories that stayed with you...

1926
03:22:57,494 --> 03:22:59,257
that meant something.

1927
03:22:59,429 --> 03:23:01,989
Even if you were too small to understand why.

1928
03:23:03,366 --> 03:23:07,234
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.

1929
03:23:07,404 --> 03:23:08,962
I know now.

1930
03:23:09,806 --> 03:23:12,001
Folk in those stories...

1931
03:23:12,175 --> 03:23:16,305
had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.

1932
03:23:16,479 --> 03:23:18,709
They kept going...

1933
03:23:19,382 --> 03:23:22,647
because they were holding on to something.

1934
03:23:24,287 --> 03:23:26,585
What are we holding on to, Sam?

1935
03:23:38,468 --> 03:23:42,404
That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.

1936
03:23:42,672 --> 03:23:45,300
And it's worth fighting for.

1937
03:24:12,235 --> 03:24:16,535
I think at last we understand
one another, Frodo Baggins.

1938
03:24:17,274 --> 03:24:21,233
You know the laws of our
country, the laws of your father.

1939
03:24:21,411 --> 03:24:23,606
If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.

1940
03:24:27,984 --> 03:24:29,383
Then it is forfeit.

1941
03:24:32,155 --> 03:24:33,850
Release them.

1942
03:24:45,936 --> 03:24:47,995
Stay out of the forest!

1943
03:24:48,171 --> 03:24:49,968
Keep away from the trees!

1944
03:25:40,790 --> 03:25:42,587
Final count...

1945
03:25:42,759 --> 03:25:45,660
- 42.
- 42?

1946
03:25:47,130 --> 03:25:51,897
That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.

1947
03:25:52,702 --> 03:25:56,365
I myself am sitting pretty on 43.

1948
03:26:00,477 --> 03:26:03,776
- 43.
- He was already dead.

1949
03:26:04,547 --> 03:26:07,038
- He was twitching.
- He was twitching...

1950
03:26:07,217 --> 03:26:11,916
because he's got my ax embedded in his nervous system!

1951
03:26:14,157 --> 03:26:18,856
- He doesn't look too happy, does he?
- Not too happy at all, Merry.

1952
03:26:19,129 --> 03:26:22,656
Still, I suppose the view would
be quite nice from up there.

1953
03:26:22,832 --> 03:26:25,801
Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment.

1954
03:26:25,969 --> 03:26:28,802
I hear the staff are very good.

1955
03:26:34,477 --> 03:26:36,843
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

1956
03:26:37,013 --> 03:26:41,279
- The world's back to normal, that's all.
- No, it isn't.

1957
03:26:41,451 --> 03:26:42,679
I'm starving.

1958
03:26:42,886 --> 03:26:45,946
Good luck trying to find something decent around here.

1959
03:26:46,156 --> 03:26:49,182
Probably dead rats and moldy bread.

1960
03:27:13,183 --> 03:27:15,583
Saruman's storeroom!

1961
03:27:17,954 --> 03:27:20,650
I don't believe it.

1962
03:27:20,857 --> 03:27:22,882
It can't be.

1963
03:27:23,526 --> 03:27:26,427
- It is!
- Longbottom Leaf.

1964
03:27:27,730 --> 03:27:30,028
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.

1965
03:27:30,400 --> 03:27:33,426
It's perfect. One barrel each.

1966
03:27:33,603 --> 03:27:34,729
Wait.

1967
03:27:35,472 --> 03:27:36,700
Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?

1968
03:27:36,873 --> 03:27:38,397
Share it?

1969
03:27:40,243 --> 03:27:42,643
No. No.

1970
03:27:44,147 --> 03:27:45,478
Dead plant and all that.

1971
03:27:45,915 --> 03:27:48,076
Don't think he'd understand.

1972
03:27:49,385 --> 03:27:51,546
Could be a distant relative.

1973
03:27:52,355 --> 03:27:54,846
I get it.

1974
03:27:55,058 --> 03:27:57,856
Don't be hasty.

1975
03:27:58,962 --> 03:28:00,725
Exactly.

1976
03:28:01,798 --> 03:28:04,062
Bar-hrum.

1977
03:28:29,726 --> 03:28:31,023
This is the old sewer.

1978
03:28:31,194 --> 03:28:34,254
Runs right under the river
through to the edge of the city.

1979
03:28:34,430 --> 03:28:36,159
You'll find cover in the woods there.

1980
03:28:37,233 --> 03:28:39,701
Captain Faramir...

1981
03:28:40,336 --> 03:28:42,167
you have shown your quality, sir.

1982
03:28:44,674 --> 03:28:45,971
The very highest.

1983
03:28:46,476 --> 03:28:49,104
The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee...

1984
03:28:49,279 --> 03:28:52,214
where gardeners are held in high honor.

1985
03:28:53,416 --> 03:28:55,384
What road will you take once you reach the woods?

1986
03:28:56,019 --> 03:28:57,543
Gollum says there's a path...

1987
03:28:57,754 --> 03:29:01,690
near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.

1988
03:29:02,158 --> 03:29:03,887
Cirith Ungol?

1989
03:29:07,430 --> 03:29:09,990
- Is that its name?
- No.

1990
03:29:10,166 --> 03:29:11,827
No!

1991
03:29:12,669 --> 03:29:15,661
- Yes.
- Frodo...

1992
03:29:16,039 --> 03:29:19,566
they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul.

1993
03:29:20,476 --> 03:29:23,001
- You cannot go that way.
- It is the only way.

1994
03:29:23,346 --> 03:29:29,615
Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.

1995
03:29:31,154 --> 03:29:32,917
I must.

1996
03:29:36,459 --> 03:29:40,020
Go, Frodo. Go with the goodwill of all Men.

1997
03:29:40,196 --> 03:29:42,221
Thank you.

1998
03:29:54,043 --> 03:29:58,173
May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.

1999
03:30:10,660 --> 03:30:12,184
Come on, keep up.

2000
03:30:15,665 --> 03:30:18,463
Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you.

2001
03:30:19,102 --> 03:30:20,933
You know that, don't you?

2002
03:30:21,738 --> 03:30:23,296
He was trying to save you, see?

2003
03:30:23,806 --> 03:30:25,330
Save me?

2004
03:30:25,675 --> 03:30:27,836
So there's no hard feelings.

2005
03:30:28,011 --> 03:30:33,074
- Forgive and forget.
- No, no, no hard feelings.

2006
03:30:33,249 --> 03:30:35,877
Gollum, Gollum.

2007
03:30:36,953 --> 03:30:38,682
Yes, master.

2008
03:30:39,789 --> 03:30:42,622
- Nice Hobbits.
- Very decent of you.

2009
03:30:42,792 --> 03:30:45,090
Very decent, indeed, Gollum.

2010
03:30:50,600 --> 03:30:55,799
Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.

2011
03:31:02,945 --> 03:31:05,937
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

2012
03:31:06,616 --> 03:31:10,143
The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.

2013
03:31:15,325 --> 03:31:18,761
All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits...

2014
03:31:19,729 --> 03:31:22,960
somewhere in the wilderness.

2015
03:31:26,269 --> 03:31:29,670
I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.

2016
03:31:29,839 --> 03:31:31,204
What?

2017
03:31:31,374 --> 03:31:35,276
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

2018
03:31:35,445 --> 03:31:38,710
And they'll say, "Yes! That's
one of my favorite stories."

2019
03:31:38,881 --> 03:31:41,816
"Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad?"

2020
03:31:41,984 --> 03:31:43,645
"Yes, my boy.

2021
03:31:43,853 --> 03:31:47,653
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

2022
03:31:47,824 --> 03:31:50,315
Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:

2023
03:31:50,526 --> 03:31:52,426
"Samwise the Brave."

2024
03:31:52,595 --> 03:31:55,325
I want to hear more about Sam.

2025
03:31:59,635 --> 03:32:02,627
Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.

2026
03:32:03,973 --> 03:32:08,000
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't
make fun. I was being serious.

2027
03:32:09,112 --> 03:32:10,477
So was I.

2028
03:32:19,389 --> 03:32:22,051
"Samwise the Brave."

2029
03:32:26,362 --> 03:32:27,693
Smeagol?

2030
03:32:27,864 --> 03:32:30,765
We're not going to wait for you. Come on.

2031
03:32:30,933 --> 03:32:32,867
Master.

2032
03:32:33,035 --> 03:32:35,936
Master looks after us.

2033
03:32:36,706 --> 03:32:39,504
Master wouldn't hurt us.

2034
03:32:39,675 --> 03:32:42,143
Master broke his promise.

2035
03:32:42,311 --> 03:32:44,472
Don't ask Smeagol.

2036
03:32:44,647 --> 03:32:47,844
Poor, poor Smeagol.

2037
03:32:48,017 --> 03:32:50,850
Master betrayed us.

2038
03:32:51,053 --> 03:32:54,113
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

2039
03:32:54,323 --> 03:32:58,225
We ought to wring his filthy little neck.

2040
03:32:58,394 --> 03:33:01,124
Kill him! Kill him!

2041
03:33:01,297 --> 03:33:02,787
Kill them both!

2042
03:33:02,965 --> 03:33:06,594
And then we take the precious...

2043
03:33:06,769 --> 03:33:10,296
and we be the master!

2044
03:33:10,973 --> 03:33:13,635
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

2045
03:33:13,810 --> 03:33:16,472
Eyes always watching.

2046
03:33:16,646 --> 03:33:20,207
Then we stabs them out.

2047
03:33:20,383 --> 03:33:24,877
Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.

2048
03:33:25,087 --> 03:33:28,523
Yes. Yes. Yes.

2049
03:33:28,724 --> 03:33:31,420
Kill them both.

2050
03:33:31,594 --> 03:33:33,994
Yes. No! No!

2051
03:33:34,197 --> 03:33:37,894
It's too risky. It's too risky.

2052
03:33:38,601 --> 03:33:41,195
Where is he? Where has he gone?

2053
03:33:41,370 --> 03:33:43,964
- Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
- Smeagol?

2054
03:33:44,140 --> 03:33:49,544
We could let her do it.

2055
03:33:50,513 --> 03:33:54,643
Yes. She could do it.

2056
03:33:54,817 --> 03:33:59,379
Yes, precious, she could.

2057
03:33:59,589 --> 03:34:05,585
And then we takes it once they're dead.

2058
03:34:06,562 --> 03:34:09,395
Once they're dead.

2059
03:34:13,803 --> 03:34:17,500
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

2060
03:34:17,673 --> 03:34:19,732
Smeagol will show you the way.

2061
03:34:19,909 --> 03:34:22,139
Follow me.
