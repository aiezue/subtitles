I die
for the Revolution.
No Chinese Woman has yet shed blood for the Revolution.
I shall be the first,
although the world doesn't know much about the Revolution.
I leave behind my husband and children.
My death
is my contribution to the Revolution.
It will build an indestructible home for all people,
a peaceful and calm world for all children.
The long-enslaved masses are numb,
they know not peace, nor calm.
These two children
will soon lose their mother.
I die for all children.
I die for the Revolution.
I'm not afraid, nor do I care about death.
I rejoice at my martyrdom:
At this moment
I cry with blissful tears.
Put the donation boxes in prominent spots.
Go over to the door.
Be vigilant.
Yes.
Let Mr. Sun rest.
Don't disturb him.
Yes.
Juemin.
Who's that?
Who?
Look.
What?
Go, quick.
Get up, there's a woman here.
Don't bother, just go.
Keqiang.
Time to get up.
Get up.
Let me sleep three more minutes.
Alright.
Get up.
Two minutes.
Fine.
Two minutes.
One minutes.
I'll get up.
I should go to Guangzhou for the uprising.
What?
You forgot the committee's decision last night?
Keqiang, listen.
I won't.
I must throw myself into battle.
Then last night's meeting was a waste.
Why can't we talk it through again?
There's nothing to discuss.
Huang Xing leads the Guangzhou uprising.
Sun Wen handles fundraising overseas.
We voted.
Promise.
Promise.
These are donations from abroad.
Overseas Chinese helped us.
I promised them.
I cannot fail them,
I must carry out my pledge.
It's not a personal promise
but Tongmenghui's promise.
They wrote these letters.
Who's this Woman?
Zonghan.
Xu Zonghan.
Tongmenghui member from my village.
I'm Huang Xing.
Zonghan coordinates underground organizations in Guangzhou.
You two pretend to be husband and wife.
It's a good cover.
No, it's not appropriate.
Why not?
I'm a woman and I don't care.
What are you afraid of?
It's easy to die in battle,
but hard to motivate the living.
You have the difficult task.
The Guangzhou uprising will finish off the Qing Dynasty.
Take this pocket watch.
On the day of the uprising,
we'll monitor time together.
Go,
Charge.
Quick.
Quick.
Destroy this wall.
Yes.
You rebel.
You dare revolt.
You revolutionary.
You dare revolt.
You...
You...
Where's Zhang Mingqi?
I don't know.
Quick.
And my Wife.
Quick.
Comrades taking part in the uprising
know me better.
It's easier for me to coordinate...
Nonsense.
I can wield my pen
and scalpel,
why not a gun?
Remember: You're still a wanted man by the Qing court,
you can't risk it.
If you return to China to lead the uprising,
you're being irresponsible.
Yu Peilun.
Yu Peilun.
Yu Peilun.
Here.
We couldn't Contact the other groups.
Zhang Mingqi ran away.
Keqiang said,
if the uprising fails,
you must inform Sun Wen immediately.
What else did he say?
He said,
if he's not back by dusk,
you must leave Guangzhou at once.
Quick.
Back off. All of you.
Listen to my command.
Attack from the sides.
- Yes. - Hand grenades.
- Yes. - Follow me.
Charge.
Charge.
Keqiang.
Your hand.
Keqiang.
Don't mind me, charge.
Yes.
Charge.
Get away.
Run.
- What are you doing? - Run.
Let me go.
Let me go.
Yu Peilun.
Gentlemen,
our fundraiser today
was originally organized for the Guangzhou uprising.
But just now,
I received news.
Fighting in Guangzhou has ceased.
The uprising has failed.
The telegram states,
the uprising failed,
many of our core members are dead.
You've never met them.
These young people who died were talented,
some came from rich families,
some have just gotten married.
They were willing to sacrifice themselves,
whatever the cost.
They sacrificed their lives for the cause
because they have faith.
What do your lies
have to do with us?
Good question.
Most of you gathered here
are overseas Chinese.
You know Well
our faces mark us as Chinese,
and we've suffered discrimination
and bullying.
We've endured unfair treatment.
All because the country of our people
has long been corrupt
and weak,
writhing in pain.
Our Chinese compatriots
face adversity,
our land taken by others.
Our Revolution
ensures people can pursue happiness,
that our race will regain dignity.
The Chinese revolutionary movement is blessed by support from overseas Chinese.
For many years,
I strongly believe this.
Overseas Chinese are the mother of the Revolution.
Gentlemen,
your children
have died for you.
Fang Shengdong.
Lin Shishuang.
Yu Peilun.
Chen Gengxin.
Lin Juemin.
This young man will soon be a father.
What's this?
US$300,000.00
Donation from Zhigongtang
I won't hide this from you.
We sold our ancestral house.
Yat-sen,
we're overseas Chinese,
our roots are in China.
The Qing Dynasty is no longer our home.
Without a place called home,
why Keep an ancestral house?
Take it.
If the Revolution fails,
you'll owe us for generations.
Another one.
Yat-sen,
your pocket Watch
can block bullets,
but not cannon shells.
Fire.
Empress Dowager,
I hear.
Sun Wen has long escaped abroad,
he hasn't returned for more than a decade.
We might want to arrest him,
but it's going to be hard.
Didn't we alert our envoys
and foreign governments
about Sun, telling them
they should monitor his movements?
But Sun gives public lectures everywhere,
raising funds, organizing rebels,
trafficking arms, plotting uprisings.
Minister Xu, perhaps you overstate.
He hasn't appeared before our eyes.
He's only mortal,
not the Monkey King.
What power can he wield?
Sun's done enough to rock the boat.
These years, unrest seethes everywhere,
rebellions follow one after another.
Sun's been misleading others with his lies,
so many follow his path.
What a troublemaker.
As if he doesn't make enough trouble.
The Qing Dynasty will not fall because of him.
If he dares enter the Forbidden City,
our Manchurian imperial army will kill him.
Yes,
let's just eradicate.
Sun Wen and his cohorts.
We'll destroy them once and for all.
Stop carrying on like this.
No matter whether to kill them,
or praise or punish them,
or whatever other solution,
I only have this to say:
Please, all of you,
let Us have some peace.
Recently,
the mortgage of our railways
against the Four Nations Bank loan
has led to riots.
What's the use of your rifles?
Tell them:
If they revolt,
they'll all die in vain.
Lin Juemin.
You're educated,
you come from a good family.
Why did you join the rebels?
Zhang Mingqi,
why do you hide in darkness?
What are you afraid of?
What am I afraid of?
You're afraid of my youth.
I have chosen death,
but I'm still young.
You might live,
but you are old and worthless.
Have you read the study of evolution?
Survival of the fittest.
Have you considered
the leading nations in the world
were all borne of revolution?
China must also have a revolution.
Affairs of the nation
are not your concern.
Sun Wen said,
China is Weak.
There's no way out.
The royal family, aristocrats and officials
all follow their old ways,
but what of the people?
They barely survive, ignorant of the world.
China is no match for other countries,
it's a dire situation.
Young man,
the Qing court has a hard time too.
The court?
The court gave Hong Kong to England
and Taiwan to Japan.
That's the good Work of the Qing court.
What's the use of keeping it?
I'm interrogating you,
yet you turn around to question me?
You have no grounds to sentence me.
Lin Juemin,
I had wanted to exercise clemency.
There's no need.
My comrades and I fought together,
we'll die together.
I can't be an exception.
When you die,
you'll be left with nothing.
The Qing court wants my life;
I'll destroy the dynasty at its heart.
Hello, Your Royal Highness,
this is a car used by British royalty.
As a member of Chinese royalty, let me try.
Please.
You've come because of the Sichuan railways?
The loan agreements between our countries
and the mortgage of your railways cannot be written off.
That's the trouble.
I knew it.
The mortgage of the Sichuan and Guangdong railways
against your loan
will lead to trouble down the road.
If you forcibly take the railways,
it'll be a catastrophe.
Can't we find a solution, my dear lord?
Look at this invention.
It's an iron machine.
It can move forward and backward,
left and right,
whatever you wish.
My lord,
please enjoy this humble gift
and steer it in the right direction.
Mr. Ambassador,
we've already sent troops from Wuchang
to suppress the Sichuan riots.
Don't you worry.
Your Royal Highness, you're a great strategist.
You're the one holding the steering wheel.
You have money,
you have navel fleets,
you've always been better businessmen than us.
In 50 years,
the car you gave me
will be scrap metal,
but my little gift to you
will be priceless.
Thank you.
Open the door. Huang Keqiang.
Quick, open the door. Huang Keqiang
I Know you're inside..
Open,
Huang Keqiang.
Huang Keqiang,
open the door.
Open the door for me.
What are you doing?
Put it down.
Give me the blade.
Let me go.
What are you doing?
What?
You can't die.
I know you saw
all of them being killed.
I know
we failed.
I didn't want to die, Zonghan
I want to keep this hand
to wield the gun.
Help me,
chop it off.
No.
- No. - So we failed,
we've failed before.
No.
Children,
do you know what the telegram says?
No.
Huang Keqiang is alive.
Fate has been kind.
Who's he?
Huang Keqiang
is a strong and determined man,
a man who won't die.
We don't know him.
But do you know Homer Lea?
Yes.
Take me to him, please.
Yes.
Where's Homer Lea?
There.
Homer Lea.
Homer.
Homer.
- Homer. - Hey, I'm here.
Mr. Lea,
tell me.
Why are you so interested in Chinese revolution?
Nowadays,
a Chinese revolution
is the only thing that can make exciting history.
Exciting?
That's not what our revolution is about.
Why revolution?
I was once a doctor.
I used to save a lot of lives
with my scalpel.
But sadly,
in my country,
life is so miserable
it might be Worse than death.
I always wonder
why my compatriots
have to endure their lives with no dignity.
They survive like animals
with very basic needs,
suffering the oppression from the ruling class
and foreign powers.
Now,
I cannot accept it,
I will not accept it.
I want to change.
I want a revolution.
Come,
I'll show you.
Recently, in Sichuan,
the central part of China, people have launched a movement
of protecting railway projects against the hopelessly corrupt Qing government.
It is said that the Qing government has to mobilize the army from Hubei province o Sichuan.
What they don't know is many officers who stayed behind in the army of.
Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangsu,
are active members of Tongmenghui, the Restoration League,
I have a feeling
that in the south of Yangtze River,
an even bigger movement
will take hold.
I want to join your revolution.
That's fine.
I would like to invite you
to join the Chinese Revolution as a military advisor,
but I'm afraid I cannot afford you and pay the attention that you deserve.
This,
this is not about money.
It's about you, Sun.
You must be China's revolutionary leader.
I promise you.
Peng Chufan.
Liu Fuji. Yang Hongsheng.
The three of them plotted mutiny.
Now punishment is upon them.
We execute them today
as a Warning to all.
Among you...
Governor,
we found the list. What should we do?
What else can we do with
those rebels from the Gongjinhui?
Starting tonight,
kill everyone on the list.
No one will be spared.
All of you,
ask your own conscience.
The Qing court supports
and protects you,
yet you plot to rebel,
following such thugs as Sun Wen.
Isn't that the behavior of unfilial sons,
killing their parents?
Stop, you two.
What are your names?
Xiong Bingkun of the 8th regiment, 8th engineering battalion.
Jin Zheolong of the 8th regiment, 8th engineering battalion.
Lie low.
This is a crisis.
Don't be hot-tempered.
Yes.
What is this?
A mutiny?
Not sleeping?
What do you want?
What?
This is a mutiny.
Tao Qisheng.
Brother,
put down your rifle.
I'm leading a mutiny.
How many more will you kill?
You're lucky that
I'm aiming at you.
Brother,
this is not a joke.
If we don't do it now, then when?
Help.
Tell Zhang Zhenwu to bring two of his battalions.
Aim all artillery at the Governor's mansion.
When Xiong Bingkun lights the torch,
fire at the mansion.
Yes.
Charge.
Hand grenades.
Go.
Jin Zhaolong
Jin Zhaolong, Xiong Bingkun.
Lead two platoons.
Order everyone to bring gas canisters.
Rush in to fuel the fire.
Light the target.
Yes.
- Quick. - Quick.
Quick.
Quick.
Ready,
aiming at the Governor's mansion.
Load.
Done.
Fire.
Load.
Fire.
Good morning, Mrs. Johnson.
Good morning.
Here.
Oh, yes.
Oh, Dr. Sun.
Yes?
It seems like there's something in today's paper about China.
Thank you.
Do you need some help, Dr. Sun?
Can I give you some water?
I'm all right.
Yat-sen.
Hey, what's going on in here?
What are you guys doing?
Come on.
Yat-sen. The Revolution has succeeded.
- Hey, what's the matter with you? - Sorry.
On October 10,
The Revolutionary army took over Wuchang.
Governor Rui Cheng fled overnight.
Wuchang revolutionaries telegraphed the entire country,
asking them to join in the rebellion. The world's in shock.
Yat-sen,
you should return to China immediately.
I'll reserve a boat ticket for you.
You only need to spend 20 days across the Pacific, then you'll reach Shanghai.
It happened in Wuchang.
It happened in Wuchang.
Send a telegram to Keqiang in Hong Kong,
so he travels to Wuchang to lead the revolution.
Yes.
Sun,
I'm ready.
I'll go to China with you.
No.
I'm going to Europe first.
Huang Xing is much better than me to handle this in China.
Why?
The unrest in China
will be closely linked to the Four Nations Bank loan to the Qing court.
The court's out of money now,
but if they get the loan,
they can thwart the revolution.
Reserve tickets for Europe.
Zonghan,
don't bother making dinner.
We're running out of time.
Put it down.
Why are you so anxious?
You don't need it.
The battle in Wuchang will be intense.
I'm concerned for your safety.
What about your own safety?
Don't Worry,
I won't die.
Fate will be kind to me.
I should go now.
Go.
What happened?
Only yesterday Rui Cheng reported to us
that the rebel leaders were killed.
A day passed and...
The New Army had it easy.
Clearly,
the Wuchang regiments were sent to Sichuan to stop the unrest,
so the city was unguarded...
Tell me something I don't already know.
The Qing court has ruled for more than 200 years. We've ridden through many storms.
It's only a small flame, we'll extinguish it.
Who should we send
to extinguish this flame?
Empress Dowager,
I humbly believe...
I recommend Yin Chang, head of the Imperial Army.
This is his duty.
Xu Shichang.
Yes.
Just now,
what were you saying?
Yuan Shikai can fulfill this task.
Better to appoint Yin Chang.
This is family affair.
It's better to send over a Manchu.
Yes.
Empress Dowager,
I would like to submit a request.
Say it, Royal Prince.
Food and supplies precede an army.
There's this old saying...
Be precise,
- don't just quote the classics. - In my opinion,
We should finalize the loan
from the Four Nations Bank,
we'll have less to worry about later.
Haven't we discussed this for months?
Why hasn't this been done?
The Four Nations Bank felt
we've been indecisive
about mortgaging our railways.
There's been criticism outside.
People say that
we're giving away our sovereignty.
If we're not rulers here,
is this even a country?
General Li,
for the sake of the times, please decide.
I've treated you well.
Why are you making it so difficult for me?
We ask that you lead the Military Government.
We're not making it difficult.
Drop your gun.
Please ask him to drop his gun.
Put it down.
General Li,
you've treated us well.
We wish you'd lead the Military Government.
You nave great talents among the revolutionary ranks.
Why don't you ask Sun Wen to be your leader?
Li Yuanhong.
The revolutionary party will select our leaders.
At present.
Sun Wen is still abroad,
and Huang Keqiang is on his Way here.
That's why we offer you this.
Li Yuanhong,
do you understand your predicament?
I can give up my position in the Qing court,
but I don't want to become a revolutionary official.
I only want to return home.
You have no idea of the real situation:
Although Rui Cheng and Zhang Biao have gone into hiding,
if the court's troops were to counterattack,
they can destroy Wuchang in a second.
Come back.
Stop.
- Come back. - Go.
Stop.
Go.
Lie down.
Yin Chang's firing at us from a German battleship.
General Li,
are you all right?
What damned battle is this?
I'll die because of you.
Remove the ammunition, quick.
We'll die together.
We'll count you as a revolutionary martyr.
Li Yuanhong, General of the Mixed Brigade.
I'm Military Governor Li Yuanhong.
If you Want to live,
return to your stations.
Attention.
Yes.
Target: Battleship "Chuyu"

Cease fire.
Why did we stop?
I'm the Military Governor,
I make all the decisions.
Why did they stop?
They ran out of ammunition?
Doesn't look like it.
Should we fire back to test them?
What for?
Better keep our lives. Run.
Run.
Even if we annihilate Yin Chang,
so what?
He's of no consequence.
The real battle is ahead of us.
Yes.
You want to cut my queue?
Fine.
Come.
Since you revolutionaries have bestowed such honour on me,
I'll be presumptuous and break the law.
Father.
Good news.
You scared away my fish.
You're coming out of seclusion.
You can't hold your horses, can you?
General, Huafu is here.
Huafu.
Let's show
the revolutionaries and those in the Forbidden City
our great Beiyang Army
and our great power.
Yes.
Attention, artillery.
Target ahead,
25° to the right,
distance at 500.
Load.
Ready.
Fire.

Keqiang.
Where should We go?
Wherever there's heavy gunfire.
Make way.
Make way.
Commander.
Avoid gunfire.
Avoid gunfire.
Hide in the trench with your squad.
Hide in the trench.
Hide in the trench.
Don't run.
Don't run.
Go back.
Don't run.
Retrieve the gun.
Remember,
alive soldier is useless
without his weapon.
Tell me, Huafu.
Tell me.
General,
We've taken.
Hankou.
Your order to Scorch
we attack Wuchang right away.
Now gives us access to Wu...
What's your next step?
Morale is high,
we attack Wuchang right away.
Great.
We take Hankou first,
then attack Beijing.
We'll conquer the world.
Sit down, have some food.
This is a Heaven-sent opportunity.
Sit down.
Keding,
you're cutting to the quick.
Let's wait on.
Wuchang.
After the rabbit is killed,
the hunting dog will be cooked.
Enemy positions nave advanced.
Once they cover their firing range,
the infantry will attack.
The key to combat is to avoid gunfire.
Yes.
Idiot,
trying to run away? I'll kill you.
Drop your gun.
He's Huang Xing, our Commander.
Salute.
I command you all:
From now on,
follow my orders.
Yes.
Always be prepared to enter the frontlines.
Yes.
We torched Hankou well,
it was a great offense.
But now,
we won't follow up.
If the revolutionaries can be easily defeated,
the country still belongs to the Qing court.
If the Qing court is also weak,
the revolutionaries could seize power.
Somehow,
we must be get a share of it.
Here's my condition:
I take full power over the army and its supplies.
Now.
Empress Dowager Longyu and the princes must Know that
they either get the loan from the Four Nations Bank,
or there'll be no more battle.
Regarding the revolutionaries...
Should we Contact Li Yuanhong and test the waters?
He's not a revolutionary.
In the long run,
we should find someone we can connect with.
Sun Yat-sen and Huang Xing.
Reporting to the General.
Wang Jingwei is here.
Please.
Isn't Wang
supposed to be in Beijing, in prison?
Zaifeng released him.
You were locked up for a year.
You've suffered.
Times have changed, don't mention it any more.
I treasure you most among the revolutionaries.
I was just telling Keding,
we should swear as blood brothers.
Zhaoming,
tell me.
What do the revolutionaries want?
We Want to establish a republic.
Republic?
But Why?
Feudalism has kept China
back for far too long.
As long as there's an Emperor,
we cannot rid ourselves of the old system.
The Revolution must
depose the Emperor
and the imperial system.
That's all theory.
We have to put it in practice.
When the Republic is established,
who will lead it?
A leader of the Republic is elected by all citizens.
Zhaoming.
The General pondered seriously
before inviting you from Beijing.
He'd like your help.
You're the one who knows
the revolutionaries well.
Zhaoming
ls Sun Wen still abroad?
Gentlemen.
Gentlemen,
you know who I am
and Why I'm here.
It seems to me
that you have decided that you're against the revolution.
Am I right?
Go.
If that's the case,
the Qing government will take this loan,
buy guns and shoot through
the hearts of revolutionaries.
Your money will support the corrupt Qing government,
in exchange for What?
Railway?
Our railway.
Sir.
Sir,
please keep your voice down.
You're deciding the future of my country here.
Being a Chinese,
I have the right to know what's going on here.
We've already informed your government
regarding our decision.
You must tell me your decision.
Let me remind you that we're in Europe.
You really should behave like a gentleman.
Do you understand what's happening in China now?
Mr. Sun Wen.
He won't answer.
They are bankers,
they only care about their money,
not other people's fate.
Mr. Hillier,
do you know who he is?
No.
He's the man who will decide the future of China.
Who are you?
Tang Manrou.
Idiot.
Your father is the Chinese Imperial Ambassador,
and you spoke for Sun Wen?
Do you know who he is?
Who is he?
He's a traitor of the Qing Dynasty.
He's a wanted criminal.
He's a revolutionary.
Don't you know?
Tang Manrou.
I know who he is,
that's why I helped him.
Mr. Hillier.
Hillier.
I must go before this person arrives.
We cannot be present in the same place.
Why leave, Minister Tang?
I beg you, you still haven't done us
the honour of accepting our invitation.
You really mustn't leave.
Please. Don't leave.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I'm well aware that I've come here uninvited.
However,
as the leader of the Chinese revolution, I only ask you,
please reconsider the 6 million pounds,
your loan to the Qing government.
Sun Wen,
you're a subject of the Qing Dynasty,
yet you show no respect for your country.
How can you claim any respect regarding our country?
You've lost it all a long time ago.
I represent the Whole Chinese people,
and speak in the name as leader of the Chinese revolution.
Dr. Sun,
we will not break
such an important business contract.
Mr. Thompson,
this is not a business contract,
it's a political deal.
If this contract is signed, what's at stake here
is Chinese sovereignty.
Mr. Sun,
our German banks only care about business,
we don't care about domestic politics.
My dearest German delegates,
every time the Qing government fires a gun at us,
your money presses the trigger.
The Qing government will buy weapons with your loan, nothing else.
Perhaps you've misunderstood.
According to my understanding, this loan is intended to help rebuild the railways.
Mr. Sun,
our minister in Peking,
Sir John Newell Jordan,
said the same thing about the loan.
Dear Sir Buchanan,
I believe when Mr. Jordan realizes
that the money is used to destroy the Chinese revolution,
he will change his mind.
Sun Wen.
This is my second warning.
Do not defame the Qing Dynasty here.
Defame?
Minister Tang,
how you underestimated us.
We Want to depose you and the court.
Gentlemen,
we all know that to give good money
to a bad client
is a fatal mistake.
The Qing government is like a patient diagnosed with cancer.
Your loan is like sugar pills,
it'll only make him feel better,
but the fate is sealed.
It seems that you are quite pessimistic about the future in China.
No, I'm not.
On the contrary,
my vision of the new China
is very positive.
I see huge miles covered with natural resources.
I see thousands of banks providing new capital.
I see a mountain of railways connecting all the modern communities.
Gentlemen,
you are bankers,
you should know to invest your money wisely.
Would you rather invest your money
into a dying government or the emerging one?
Mr. Sun Yat-sen,
I know you are the leader of this revolution,
and I respect your revolution.
However, we cannot invest money against the interests of our own nation.
You may know that
I'm a surgeon.
As a doctor, my duty
is to save my patient's life.
One day
I found my country
is suffering cancer.
Mr. Hillier,
The situation of China
is like this roast lamb,
it's unlikely our people
would enjoy freedom,
equality
and fraternity.
Yes,
that is to say,
this is China.
And all of you Want a piece.
Germany
here's your piece,
the Shandong peninsula.
Good location, isn't it?
What's all this?
Sir Buchanan,
your piece,
left rather small on this plate:
Only Hong Kong,
and you know very well,
this is a gate
to reach China.
Mr. Thompson, let me out out a special piece for you,
in memory of all those Chinese lives
that were lost carving out your mountain for the transcontinental railway
where they sleep, buried, the bones of Chinese labourers.
It's a pity,
all those countries not here today:
Russia,
Japan and Portugal.
They want Pescadores, Liaodong Peninsula
and Macau.
Gentlemen,
this
is the last time you can gather to feast on China.
I really hope
I made my point clear.
Mr. Tang,
please wait a moment. Please.
Go home.
Please.
Please stay.
Stay.
Here it is.
Please tell me, what does Revolution mean?
Like a doctor who heals patients,
a revolution saves an entire people.
Mr. Sun,
I heard girls in China
have to bound their feet from young age.
Is it painful?
Yes, it's painful
but
it will be gone very soon.
I see. Thank you.
Must people
lose their lives in revolution?
The final goal of revolution isn't death,
but to change fate.
Young people sacrificed themselves for the revolution,
so those living can lead better lives.
Extend firing range.
Come.
It's overheated. It won't fire.
Go, piss.
Lie down.
Lie down.
Nurse.
Little Hubei,
gather hand grenades.
Give them to me.
- Give them to me. - No.
Let go.
- Commander. - Let go.
Don't pull me back.
Don't pull me back.
Let go.
Let go.
Go.
Little Hubei.
Ammunition handler.
Charge.
General,
Huafu is here.
General,
We've taken Hanyang.
Should we continue fighting?
There's
no need to be in such a rush.
We nave to let the Qing court understand,
if they don't pay up,
we won't move.
Your words mean...
Can't you read?
Read it yourself.
Fight slowly,
wait and see?
- But morale is high. - I must return to Beijing
and see what the Empress Dowager says.
Let me tell you my bottom line:
If the court
doesn't give me enough money,
I won't fight.
I'd thought it'd be easy to defeat them,
but Sun's rebels
are resilient.
I also lack ammunition and supplies.
Empress Dowager,
I was forced to cease
the battle of Wuchang.
Yuan Shikai.
Yes, Empress Dowager.
How much do you need?
Tell me.
If I have12 million taels of gold,
I can finish off the revolutionaries
within a few months.
If we have no money for battle,
we only have one choice:
To make peace with the revolutionaries.
You dare?
Making peace means we acknowledge them.
The Beiyang Army is on its
last round of ammunition.
I'll never agree to
your making peace.
If you really care about the Qing court,
do something useful, donate your riches.
Why don't you donate your own money to the cause?
Yuan Shikai.
Empress Dowager,
as I had reported earlier,
we must have enough money to support the army.
Yuan Shikai is indeed hard pressed.
You love to argue
all the time,
pretending to be loyal ministers.
Now
in times of crisis,
you've all become selfish.
The dynasty is destined to fall.
Your servant
will give up all of his possessions.
This is a time of crisis, I will lead
my entire family to protect the country.
Your servant
doesn't want a coffin,
nor does he care about his ancestral grave.
If money can help destroy the rebels,
then
I'll leave everything and
return to my home village.
The Four Nations Bank has been persuaded by Sun,
I'm afraid we won't receive
a cent of this loan.
I know.
Heaven will punish.
Sun Wen for this.
Empress Dowager,
even though we run out of money, food,
and ammunition,
we still have for centuries
our loyal subjects.
I only have this to say:
I will die for the Qing Dynasty.
Sun Wen, your interference...
with the Four Nations Bank loan
has generated controversy in China.
This is the Prince Regents order to assassinate you.
This one
looks more like
a portrait of the deceased.
I don't agree with you,
but I respect your courage.
I won't Kill you.
I want to persuade you.
Sun Wen, we are both past middle age.
Confucius said,
At 50, I knew my destiny.
He also said,
At 40, I am not deluded.
I've never wavered
from my beliefs.
I know Why you won't Kill me.
You're a father,
you know
the Qing court you serve
will eventually destroy your children.
We all want a strong and bright China
for our children.
Go,
I don't want to see you again.
Mr. Jordan,
you're the first guest in my new house.
Now that you've moved to Beijing,
we can see each other more often.
Yes.
I don't intend to leave the city this time.
How's the situation in the South?
Difficult.
Sun Wen and Huang Xing are southern barbarians with big appetites.
You could have conquered Wuchang,
but you stopped.
We all knew
the Qing Dynasty has run out of money,
the end is near.
You want to profit from the power balance
between the Qing court and the revolutionary army.
So now you want peace.
What do you think
of this balance between my left and right hands?
Truth be told, I'm very impressed.
But the revolutionaries won't talk to me.
Now I understand. Would you like us to extend a hand?
You...
We'll pave the way for you to negotiate peace with the revolutionaries.
It's not good for anyone if fighting continues.
What's most important now is holding onto power.
Real power.
I'm looking for a collaborator
to protect the interests of Britain in China.
Well, you've found him.
Military Governor, let me explain.
I sent Keqiang to Shanghai
because of the overall strategy of the revolutionary movement.
I don't understand.
The Wuchang uprising attracted
the world's attention.
Isn't that also part of the overall strategy?
Since we can attack Nanjing, why can't we defend Wuchang'?
In Wuchang,
we're in a stalemate with the Beiyang Army.
Our trainee soliders have suffered heavy casualties.
In Nanjing,
the enemy is weak.
Our plan is to attack Nanjing, than retake Wuchang.
'That's our overall strategy.
This is the decision made by the Tongmenghui.
I must abide by it.
Fine. Whatever you say.
But I won't go to Shanghai.
Please understand,
it hasn't been easy to forge our paths together.
My home is here.
My power base is here.
Military Governor Li,
it appears we won't be sharing
the same path.
My child, don't move.
Don't move.
Lie down.
Listen,
if you want to live,
we must amputate your leg.
Can you hear me?
Alcohol.
It's fine.
Ready?
- Be brave. - We begin now.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
Stop.
Stop.
Come.
Take him away.
You've said it before.
So we failed.
Haven't we failed before?
I'm talking to you.
Idiot.
Mr. Sun,
telegram from England for you.
Okay,
here you are.
Thank you.
Mr. Sun,
I must inform you right away.
The Four Nations Bank decided to hold off
on the loan to the Qing government.
You once told me that.
Revolution is life,
not only living,
but fate.
I don't understand Revolution,
but I've struggled and fought, I was angry.
I also knew,
I'd end up as sacrifice
along with my father.
I wish your Revolution,
I'1O,
wish our Revolution,
every SUCCESS.
Yat-sen.
Yat-sen.
Keqiang.
Where are you?
Keqiang
I'm here.
Can you hear me?
I can.
Where are you?
Huang Keqiang.
Yat-sen.
I'm starboard.
Me too.
Keqiang.
At the Welcome ceremony,
you have to put on
the revolutionary army uniform.
Yes.
Yat-sen.
Binglin, you're all here.
Not in first class?
- No. - Second class?
No.
Yat-sen.
It saved my life once.
Keqiang,
your hand.
Guangzhou uprising.
Doesn't matter.
Yat-sen.
Mr. Sun.
Dunchu.
You're here.
Yat-sen, we searched all the way to the beam.
You're all here.
A hug.
Let's go.
Yat-sen, we waited so long for your return.
Shiping, you haven't aged a bit.
Mr. Sun,
after your ship departed from Europe,
on your journey back,
what thoughts came over you?
After 16 years of tribulations,
I've returned to my motherland.
Mr. Sun,
we hear you've returned with huge donations,
ls that true?
I don't have any money.
All I bring is the Revolutionary spirit.
What is the ultimate goal of the Revolution?
The goals of the Revolution are simple:
We overthrow imperial rule
and save our people.
Mr. Sun,
what did you tell
those bankers in Europe?
I told them,
it's the Chinese people
who'll steer the fate of China,
not foreigners
or Manchu royalty.
Mr. Sun, the north and south are now negotiating peace.
What is your opinion?
My opinion is this:
We haven't reached our Revolutionary goal, we won't negotiate.
Tie up them.
Our position is that
unless the Emperor abdicates,
there'll be no peace agreement.
Our position is that
the monarchical system cannot change.
This is a family dinner. Shaochuan,
you're part of the family.
Come, try this.
A specialty from home.
Lotus root with glutinous rice.
Come, sit.
General,
this is.
To thank you.
You put in so much effort in the negotiations.
You've worked so hard.
Please tell me
what's on your mind.
You're the only one among Us
who knew Sun Wen.
I want to know more about.
Sun Wen.
What type of a man is he?
Zhang Shizhao said,
China will rise because of Sun,
he's the person
who'll revive the country.
Miyazaki considers Sun
a hero who will save China.
Kang Youwei claimed Sun is illiterate.
Wu Zhihui says that Sun is a hardworking scholar.
Some say he's like Robin Hood,
an outlaw.
Some say he's a real scholar,
an itinerant doctor holding a scalpel.
Others call him
a good-for-nothing liar.
There are many versions.
Shaochuan,
he has so many followers.
How does he do it?
I did hear this from many people:
That Sun
is selfless.
A selfless person?
Where in the world can We find one?
It's been 2000 years,
we can't wait any longer for.
- China's first Republic. - Representatives from
the 17 provinces have decided
not to elect a President, but to elect a Grand Marshal.
Mr. Sun, please sign.
A Grand Marshal cannot be head of state.
We must elect a President.
On the Presidential election,
should we wait to hear from Yuan Shikai?
If he can really hasten the Emperor's abdication...
The negotiating parties already made a pact.
Whoever first deposes the Qing government will become President.
Yuan Shikai hasn't deposed the Qing court.
We didn't break our promise.
It you insist on a Presidential election,
people will use that as an excuse to resume fighting.
So what?
We fought and look what we've achieved today.
Keqiang.
If we resume fighting, what are our chances of winning?
We have no money,
morale is low,
we have no sure chance of winning.
How can we fight?
This is impractical.
When the revolutionary army had nothing,
we were willing to sacrifice our lives.
Now we have half a country,
what are We afraid of?
The international community nee expressed support for Yuan Shikai.
Overseas Chinese all hope that we could setup e government as soon as possible
and elect a President.
To be safe,
I think we should wait.
If Yuan doesn't depose the Emperor for another 100 years,
do we still wait?
Let's put pressure on him, now.
If Yuan makes the Emperor abdicate,
do we have to keep our promise?
Even if Yuan makes the Emperor abdicate,
he isn't qualified to be President.
Not true.
If Yuan keeps his promise,
he can become President.
If you've promised him anyway, why bother holding an election?
Good question.
It's Worth it.
First,
we have to establish
the concept of a Republic.
It's just like building a road
in the wilderness,
so the Revolution can continue its path.
In future, in China,
no one can turn back.
Lie down.
Against the wall.
All of you.
Against the wall.
Against the wall.
He's the assassin.
Release him.
Who sent you here?
Sun Wen is a sinner,
he's corrupt,
he's sullied the Qing dynasty,
he's immoral,
he misleads the people,
he's beyond pardon.
Everyone can kill him.
It's no use interrogating him.
We live in entirely different worlds.
Yes.
Two days ago,
on December 27,
provincial representatives voted
and approved
the Provisional Government Organizational Draft.
They also approved the Presidential system
as well as
the nomination of candidates.
Elections will take place
today, December 29,
for the position of.
Provisional President.
I declare
each of the 17 provinces,
though some with more representatives than others,
is only given one vote.
A candidate receiving more the two-thirds of the votes
will become Provisional President.
Those in favor, raise their hands.
This is the Presidential ballot.
Your decision is crucial.
We hope you will not disappoint your people
in your choice.
Please fill in your ballot.
Homer.
Sun.
What are you doing here?
The Presidential election is ongoing in the conference hall.
I'm one of the candidates.
History,
you're making history.
I'm witnessing history.
I'm standing right beside history.
For thousands of years,
in Chinese history, we the people
never received the opportunity to
elect the head of government.
Never.
That
is what we've been fighting for.
Our people have been fighting ongoing for so long.
And now we've finally done it.
Homer,
when did you get here?
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?
Now, as head of the Assembly...
I must be there.
I declare the results.
Out of a total of 17 votes,
Sun Wen received 16.
The Provisional President of the Republic of China is.
Sun Wen.
Dr. Sun,
I heard your name.
I told you,
you'd be China's first President.
Tang Shaoyi,
didn't you say he's selfless?
What an slap in the face.
General.
Go.
Order.
Feng Guozhang and Duan Qirui
to issue a joint telegram against the Republic.
Tang Shaoyi is sympathetic to the Republic, unable to fulfill his duties,
he's dismissed as representative to the negotiations.
Yes.
Send a telegram to Wu Tingfang:
I recognize neither the Nanjing Provisional Government
nor its so-called President Sun Wen.
Yat-sen,
we just heard.
Zhang Xun has amassed
his troops around Suzhou.
Also,
some Qing soldiers have been sighted
near Qinhuai River this afternoon.
Mr. President,
we advise
delaying the inauguration ceremony.
Yes, better to be cautious.
Today is New Year's Day of 1912,
everything is renewed.
The Provisional President of the Republic of China
must be sworn in today.
Fine.
I'll take care of all security details
for the Provisional President.
Photo session.
Please, look here, here.
I pledge to overthrow the Qing dynasty,
strengthen the Republic of China,
foster better livelihoods for all.
These I promise to the people.
I will follow them.
I will serve the country with faith.
I will serve all people.
Until the hegemony of the Qing dynasty is overthrown,
and the country has no strife,
when China will stand tall in the World,
recognized among nations.
At that time,
I will resign from the position of Provisional President.
This is my pledge to all citizens of China.
Just now,
I pledged myself as the Provisional President.
Now,
I have a few words to add.
Today,
the Republic of China is established,
but the feudal court still stands.
Unless feudalism is uprooted,
our Revolution isn't complete.
I await
the day
I'll relinquish my position
to the person
who carries through the abdication of the Qing Emperor.
What's going on?
I'd said it before, we shouldn't rush to elect a President.
The Beiyang Army has been mobilized, war will erupt very soon.
I hear Yuan Shikai has even engaged assassins.
Who's afraid of assassins?
Mr. Sun,
may I suggest,
in view of the situation,
please ponder this seriously.
If Yuan Shikai doesn't depose the Qing court,
President Sun will not step down.
Does Mr. Sun want to indulge in the position of President?
Wang Zhaoming,
Sun Wen isn't that type.
Since he's so selfless,
what's the harm of my asking?
It's all about trust,
belief,
and faith
without any doubt.
I'm only afraid of
an all-out battle between North and South.
Who'd be responsible for that?
If our Revolution is stolen by someone else,
who'd be responsible for that?
Huang Keqiang, you...
Zhaoming.
Stop arguing, please.
I protect you in front of everyone,
but we must be frank behind closed doors.
You don't have to close any doors.
Just say it, Keqiang.
We cannot accede to any of Yuan Shikai's demands.
But he has the power.
He can quickly depose the Qing court.
To establish our Republic
we need not only battles but also politics.
This is Revolution,
not giving a crown to someone else.
Sun Wen,
the Revolution doesn't belong to any single person.
Keqiang,
what do you mean?
You don't understand.
Idon%?
You're accusing me of not understanding politics.
But I know Yuan Sl'1il<ai.
Keqiang.
You've never seen
how he killed young men.
I'm Worried.
He might become an enemy of the Republic.
He might
even restore autocratic rule.
It's my ninth wife's birthday.
Westerners celebrate birthdays with cakes.
But we don't.
We eat peaches.
Look how festive they ere.
It hurts.
Please let go.
It hurts.
Where's Weiting?
I need to talk to him.
What happened?
Weiting,
let's step aside.
What are you afraid of?
So what if I want to revolt?
So what?
It's high time
we race against Sun Wen.
Look, they haven't been idle:
Electing President,
setting up government.
The best peaches on the tree
are picked clean by others.
I'll kill you.
You're a madman.
Stop him. Stop him.
Sputtering madness.
Help.
Please stop him.
Stop him.
Weiting.
Calm down.
Why did you hit him so hard?
At this moment,
I can't afford even one mistake.
You're right.
It's simple.
I'm sitting on a bed of nails.
If I don't force the court,
the situation is dire:
The Revolutionaries control half the country,
I can't oppose them much longer.
But if the Emperor abdicates because of me,
I'll be blamed for generations to come.
This is indeed
a tricky situation.
The crux of the matter is,
I want to become President.
When I arrived,
I was resentful.
But now that I've seen you,
I'm no longer angry.
Now,
our baby is inside me.
Keqiang,
this painting will soon be finished.
But I can't decide
where to hang it.
I want to propose.
Wu Tingfang to issue a public statement.
If the Emperor doesn't abdicate,
the ceasefire will end.
Whoever tarries,
whoever resists,
will be punished by all.
If the truce cannot be maintained,
we'll declare war again.
If we resume war,
I'll lead the troops to the North.
Keqiang.
You were right.
I've thought long and hard.
We have to establish provisional laws.
It's unimportant who serves a single term.
We must establish
a system
to restrain not only Yuan Shikai
but
anyone who ever dreams of becoming an emperor.
Painter,
please use bright red for the flag with 18 stars.
Yes.
Comradres, I hear you are
disputing my resignation,
but it takes more than a day
of feudal hegemony.
I do hope you will not just focus on
one official title,
but create a truly relevant,
legally protected revolutionary system.
The vvol'ldisirT1h'1ehse. Those who follow the righteous path thrive,
those who do not become extinct.
I hold fast to the Revolution,
knowing it will bear fruit.
After such a long journey,
we will reach our revolutionary goal.
What does Sun Wen want?
What telegram?
What declaration? What war?
Mr. Jordan is right.
It is most important to hold onto power.
The President's chair isn't comfortable.
Even if it's full of pins,
I still Want to sit on it.
The British Ambassador told me:
That winter, like today,
the winds were chilly,
it was snowing.
It was around Spring Festival,
but the entire city was desolate,
the atmosphere almost tragic.
The guillotine was placed
in the middle of the public square,
icicles of blood
still hanging on the blade.
Louis XVI
was bound and taken there.
He was cold, without even a coat.
He was shivering.
Everyone brought their family
to witness this great occasion.
When the hour came,
the executioner put the King's head on the block,
the blade was released,
there was ice on his face.
Listen...
Go on, Yuan Shikai.
Go on.
Listen.
The whoosh of the blade.
The whoosh of the blade. Then?
Go on, Yuan Shikai.
Then, the end.
The end?
That quick?
Yuan Shikai,
you're kidding.
You're making this up.
You've made up this story from the West for me.
I reappointed you against my better conscience,
yet you do this to me?
Royal Prince, appease your anger.
Did the French also celebrate Spring Festival?
Royal Prince, calm down.
Royal Prince.
I've received news that.
Sun Wen insists on a Republic. They will not compromise.
Empress Dowager,
I tell you the story of the French Revolution
because I don't want you and the princes
to share the same fate.
I'm loyal to you.
Heaven can attest to it.
Yuan Shikai,
come over here.
Come over here.
Empress Dowager
I'm at your command.
What if
that day comes?
You won't let Us
face the guillotine,
you won't let us starve.
Certainly.
Go back.
The South is eager to resume battle,
Empress Dowager, please ponder this.
I know.
I take my leave.
- Prince Regent. - Here.
Yuan Shikai has broken his promise,
he's banded with the rebels.
I do regret this.
I dismiss him as Prime Minister.
Things have developed thus.
It won't help.
They're still dragging their feet, prolonging their dynasty?
They are acting against people's wishes.
How they overreach themselves.
They're becoming enemies of all people.
What a pipe dream,
thinking they can still hang on.
What happened?
Mr. Sun.
What is it?
Send a telegram,
make it public.
The Revolutionary Party's patience is running out.
Don't these feudalists have any shame?
Reporting to the Empress Dowager:
Our Ambassador to Russia and others have sent telegrams to you,
hoping that you treasure the Chinese people rather than insisting on one man's position.
There are mutinies in the Northeast, Xinjiang and Tibet.
43 generals, including Feng Guozhang and Duan Qirui,
have signed a petition in support of the Republic.
Tell me something I don't already know.
Empress Dowager.
We have served you and the royal court. We do not support the idea of a Republic.
Please do not falter in your position.
Why would I falter?
It's all Yuan Shikai's doing.
Yuan had betrayed Emperor Guangxu,
now he betrays Emperor Xuantong.
He's a real traitor.
His family has received such grace from the court,
yet he's such an unfilial cur.
He has the ambition of Wang Mang in becoming Emperor.
If the Emperor doesn't abdicate,
he can't make his deal.
I'd told you before, he's not to be trusted.
As long as Aisin Gioro is here,
the Qing Dynasty will not fall.
Ancestors in Heaven,
HOW
other countries bully us,
the Revolutionaries run wild,
our ministers are corrupt,
they sell whatever they can
for their own gains.
There's nothing left now.
We have failed you.
At least Sun Wen
is Clement.
He doesn't invade the Palace,
there are no guillotines.
We want a bloodless revolution,
no more sacrifices...
or needless killings.
Abdicate.
Friends, greetings.
This is a historical day,
let's begin.
- Mr. President, this way. - Let's
have a pose.
How?
- Mr. President, please lift up your hat. - OK.
Let's change a bit.
Mr. President, this way.
Mr. President, you look so young.
Such glib words.
When you cut my queue,
don't hurry,
take your time,
move slowly.
This is a historical moment, do you understand?
Yes.
You talk about Revolution and Republic all the time.
A Revolutionary has to have a Revolutionary look.
Let me show you.
Look.
Ambassadors,
Today I meet you as the Provisional President
for the first time,
also the last time.
I can't believe this.
Before I leave the Presidency,
I hope you will request your respective governments
to recognize our new country.
To you
and to the entire world,
this is truly significant.
Mr. President,
how do you plan to treat the Qing royal family?
They'll become citizens of the Republic.
The Revolutionary Party has decided
to pay the royal family 4 million taels of silver.
Is that how you treat your citizens?
Money cannot be a measure here.
Not all revolutions need guillotines.
What do you say, Mr. Ambassador?
I agree.
When I was in England,
I once met one of your parliament members, Mr. Hillier.
I told him,
when China is freed,
I'd invite him as my guest.
I'll use Chinese liquor,
Revolutionary liquor, to toast him.
Come,
cheers.
Minbao, Xinwenbao and other newspapers
nave published articles questioning your decision to step down.
I read them.
We're in financial trouble.
We can't find funds for restitutions to the martyrs' families.
We must find some money
no matter how.
People's representatives want to meet you.
Please set up a time.
Yes.
Homer Lea is determined
to resign from his post as Military Advisor.
What's his reason?
He said he won't Work with Yuan Shikai.
Tell him,
he's helping China,
not just a person.
This is a letter from Juemin.
Yat-serfs been Keeping it for you.
He asks that I give it to you.
A few days ego, members of the Tongmenghui came to see me.
They are planning a new grave.
They asked that I prepare a funerary outfit.
I went to the shop.
When he was alive,
Juemin and I always made decisions together.
So I asked,
Juemin,
which one do you want?
Only then did I know
he's no longer with me.
Zhongxin,
this is a letter from your father.
Look.
"Letter to My Wife"
shouldn't be kept only in this household.
Keep it,
let others know about it.
Yesterday,
the Qing Emperor abdicated,
ending two millennia of monarchy.
Countless revolutionaries have given up their lives
for our new Republic.
Today,
February 13, 1912,
26th day of the 12th moon of the Xinhai Year.
Keep my promise,
I resign from the post of President.
We strive for the success of the Revolution,
but do not covet recognition.
We are all of the same minds
to realize the goal of Revolution.
The goal is to establish
an independent country for the Chinese people.
We build a Chinese Republic where land is divided among all.
Nationalism, democracy, livelihood:
These are what we strive to attain,
Three Principles.
Today you ask me,
what does Revolution mean?
Perhaps people will ask the same question a century later.
Qiu Jin, our Tongmenghui member who was killed in Shaoxing, said,
Revolution will provide all children
a peaceful and gentle world.
Lin Juemin, one of the martyrs of Huanghuagang, wrote this to his wife:
Revolution seeks eternal happiness for everyone in the World.
I believe
the Revolution enables a republican system
to reach the people.
People will understand we'll fight whoever
dares support the monarchy.
Revolution enables factories,
banks, rail roads, mines
owned by Chinese to benefit the people.
Revolution enables our Chinese race to become strong,
no longer bullied by others.
We will no longer be slaves.
Revolution can take place anywhere,
anytime,
in any heart,
forever,
forever,
no longer afraid of foreign powers,
ridding the country of feudalism and royalty.
No one will be impoverished,
and the Chinese people can stand tall in the East.
This is the meaning of Revolution.

Gentlemen...
On behalf of the business community
in Kiangsu and Anhui
and the 9th Nanyang Revolutionary Army,
I nominate Ch'en Ch'i-mei as Military Governor
in charge of the Shanghai garrison.
I'm honoured by my comrades' nomination...
Objection!
I object!
From Hsu Hsi-lin to Ch'iu Chin,
members of the Restoration Society
have sacrificed for the cause.
You're not qualified for the position!
Mr. T'ao,
to draw a line with Chinese United League
is inappropriate.
This is segregation!
You're not up for the task!
T'ao Ch'eng-chang,
this is counter-revolutionary!
You have no right to label me!
I'm telling you,
even if Sun Yat-sen were here today
it's still unacceptable.
Under Emperor Shun-chih,
you needed a pigtail to keep your head.
Business was great back then.
Now, it's the exact opposite,
you'll lose your head if you wear a pigtail.
Recruiting for the New Army!
Join the New Revolutionary Army!
Hurry up and enrol!
Hurry up and enrol!
I repeat,
Join the New Army!
Join the revolution!
I'll sign up!
Dr. Sun's position is clear.
The Emperor's abdication is a prerequisite.
Peiyang Clique's bottom line is equally simple.
Yuan Shih-k'ai must become President
to counter the Ch'ing court
and force the Emperor to abdicate.
Dr. Sun made it clear,
end monarchy, stop the war
set up a republic, anything else is negotiable.
I ascended the throne at a young age,
during a time of great upheavals,
I understand the will of the people,
that honour and glory of one family
should not come before it.
I wish that people can live on in peace
- among all ethnic groups. - Your Majesty,
- Bringing everyone under one roof
- don't play with that in court.
- to form the Republic of China. - Why not?
The Emperor will step down
and continue to enjoy a monarch's privileges
Don't cry,
and personally experience this new era
because you're the Emperor.
which can only be great.
So decreed.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Though I'm unfit to become President,
upon President Sun's recommendation,
and the support of all ethnic groups,
I shall do my best
to make the Republic of China strong.
We now live in a republic, no more "long live"...
"Joint Harmony" dates back to Chou Dynasty.
According to "Records of the Grand Historian"
during the regency under Dukes Shao and Chou
state affairs were discussed
until consensus was reached.
I see.
The Emperor is gone, now we can all have a say.
Forget it!
Tse-tung,
who do you think should be President?
Dr. Sun.
Then why did Yuan get the job?
Because he has guns.
Before Dr. Sun stepped down,
he pushed through the Provisional Constitution
which will become the foundation.
A new President won't change the Republic's fate.
Party politics is our platform.
We may have conceded a title,
but as long as we win the election,
we can appoint our own cabinet members.
I'm afraid he is too aggressive.
Gentlemen, the Presidency is symbolic,
he can be anybody, or nobody.
We must dismantle one party to build another.
Let's turn the faltering Chinese United League,
whose aim was to overthrow Ch'ing Dynasty,
into Kuomintang, a true nationalist party,
the foremost political party for the Republic.
Sir!
Party politics determines
the polity of the Republic,
you must take it seriously.
Here we are!
Conduct a democratic, non-violent election,
insist on fair competition,
unite the Party!
This is important, remember it well.
I will.
Thank you.
I won't forget!
- Take care! - Take care!
- Take care! - Goodbye!
Chiao-jen!
I fear his thinking is too aggressive...
Chiao-jen!
Chiao-jen!
My mother...
Iives on humble means.
- Chiao-jen! - When I die...
I count on you...
to look after her.
Chiao-jen!
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
Hang in there!
Hang in there, Chiao-jen!
- Hang in there. - Chiao-jen!
Chiao-jen!
Chiao-jen!
At dawn on the day of the Sacrificial Rites,
the President changes with officials in attendance
then lights the ceremonial pyre,
offers jade and satin,
offers roast meat, reads first prayer...
Shih-ch'ang, the entire country seems to have
different opinions on the polity.
It's either the Japanese absolute monarchy,
the French parliamentary system,
or the American presidential system.
Which is more suitable for us?
Japanese monarchy is outdated
for a republic like ours.
That's the crux of the problem,
if we keep changing our minds,
we'll be neither here nor there.
What are you suggesting?
Follow Japan, adopt constitutional monarchy.
Had we persisted initially with that,
China would have been one of the Powers
and won't have to be bullied by foreign aggressors.
What about you, Yuan-hung?
Your wish is my command, Your Excellency.
Enough of rhetoric, this is now a Republic.
General Ts'ai!
Ts'ai O!
What are you doing?
Sir, I...
You like that?
I'll send you some later.
Thank you.
What comes after the first prayer?
Second and third prayer,
then the burning of the sacrificial offerings,
and everybody will bow in four directions.
Firstly, allow Japan to inherit
all German interests in Shantung
and agree not to cede or lease Shantung to others.
Secondly, Japanese subjects are permitted
into Southern Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia
to engage in commercial,
industrial and mining activities.
The leases on Port Arthur and Dalny,
and management of the Antung-Mukden Railway
shall be extended by 99 years.
That's daylight robbery!
Prime Minister Okuma must be out of his mind!
Is your Prime Minister out of his mind?
This document...
how can you explain to the Western Powers?
This is confidential.
Both parties have a duty to keep it as such.
Sir,
whoever leaks the contents,
regardless of his esteemed position,
will be sanctioned by Japan.
Spare me this bullshit!
Even Ito Hirobumi dared not threaten me
when he was alive.
Who do you think you are?
Your Excellency,
neither the late Ito-san
nor the Western Powers can save your skin.
Only we can do that.
Don't you want to be Emperor of China?
Have you heard?
Yuan Shih-k'ai accepted Japan's 21 Articles.
He's a traitor!
We're organising a protest, hurry...
Let's go, Tse-tung!
The strength of the Western Powers
Iies in their ability to tolerate opposition.
In Chu Chih-hsin's
"An Introduction of German social Revolutionaries"
he mentioned two western philosophers,
by the name of Marx and Engels.
Tu-hsiu!
Excuse me!
What is it?
Look!
What Yuan did was treacherous!
It's time we go home.
I heard you wish to restore monarchy.
Is that true?
Kuo-chang, you're one of us, I'll level with you.
All founding emperors in history were under 50,
I'm almost 60, too old to have this ambition.
That's good!
Whoever wants to be Emperor,
will suffer the wrath of the nation.
Sir, I must hurry back to Nanking, goodbye!
Having set the polity, with Heaven's mandate
and the will of the people ascends to the throne
and rules.
By virtue of an unanimous vote,
the Representative Assembly of the Republic
is in favour of the President
in becoming the Emperor of China.
Long live the Emperor!
Long live His Majesty!
I'm overwhelmed by your support.
I hear you insist on taking cold baths,
and advocate saving the country with able bodies.
I used to.
Not now?
I'm a bit lost.
With a weak country and inept Peiyang government,
able bodies are useless.
Guns and cannons against bows and arrows,
the outcome is obvious.
Look what happened in Shantung.
You have the answer?
Not yet, sir.
Talk is cheap,
finding the way out
may take a lifetime,
even generations.
Dad!
This is my daughter K'ai-hui,
this is Mao Tse-tung.
You're so tall.
I'll go out and play.
The question I ask of you is
what do you really want?
Say goodbye to Feng-hsien!
I wish I could bring you along.
Why don't you?
You pretended to support Yuan Shih-k'ai
so he'll let you go to Japan for treatment.
You don't want to arouse suspicion by taking me.
I only want to know, is a courtesan
really that important?
Everyone knows
I'll forsake my country for my beloved.
Without me, who'll take care of you?
Promise me you'll come back alive.
Unfortunately,
I've pledged this body and soul
to my country, not you.
Listen, you belong to 400 million Chinese
as well as to me, Hsiao Feng-hsien.
I know.
I appeal to all of you
to answer to a call of duty.
Should Yuan refuse to come to his senses,
he will be punished by an army of justice.
An army of justice?
Well said!
But where's your army?
General Ts'ai is here, sir!
Here comes my army!
You look so frail!
- Dr. Sun, I... - Take your time...
Have a seat!
Reviving the monarchy is a regression.
It's fatal to China. We must launch an expedition.
Commander-in-chief,
Captain Chu Te of the 6th detachment is here.
Go ahead.
Enemy troops defending Mienhuapo
are led by Wu of Peiyang's 6th Brigade.
Take the advance guard off duty,
Iet them rest.
We'll attack tomorrow at dawn.
We must capture Mienhuapo within a day.
Yes, sir!
Bring up all our heavy artillery.
Who the hell is their commander?
Wu P'ei-fu!
Son of a bitch!
What's going on here?
Feng Kuo-chang and the generals just declared
their opposition to the new polity.
And the Military Governor Lu Jung-t'ing
has declared Kuanghsi independent.
The country is in uproar!
Perhaps we should postpone the accession rites.
It's mere formality.
It now depends on Chen Huan and Ts'ao K'un,
if they can defeat Ts'ai O in Szechuan,
we might still have a chance.
Ts'ai is hounding me to my grave...
I'd high hopes for you, but you let me down.
Mr. Fan Ching-sheng, the Minister of Education
will now confer the letters of appointment.
On behalf of the Ministry of Education
and the National Peking University Council,
I appoint Ch'en Tu-hsiu
as Dean of the School of Letters,
Chu Hsi-chu as lecturer in Literature,
Li Ta-chao as Head Librarian,
and Ku Hung-ming as English Professor.
Isn't he the renowned academic?
Why does he dress like that?
What's so funny?
I wear my pigtail at the back of my head,
those who laugh at me wear it in their hearts.
Mine is visible,
yours is not.
Feel free to enjoy it.
How dare you! This is the Senate,
the sacred ground of the Republic.
What sacred ground?
Just a bunch of pathetic scholars
who are doomed to fail.
What do you mean, General?
I'm Peiyang's Joint Chief Military Governor,
Chang Hsun is my name.
I'm here to settle the dispute with the Senate,
Understand? I hereby proclaim
effective immediately
this dump is closed, the party is over.
Understand?
The Senate is the Republic's legislative body,
you have no right to close it down.
Listen...
I'm not only shutting down
this cackling dump of a Senate,
I'm also closing down
your bloody Republic.
Long live Your Majesty!
You may rise.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
I'm late, Your Majesty!
You may look up when you speak.
Without Your Majesty, the country is at a loss.
268 years of the glorious Ch'ing Dynasty
must not be ended by that Sun Yat-sen.
They bullied you because you're a child.
They took advantage of your age.
Alright... I appoint you as my Cabinet Minister
Viceroy of Zhili, Minister of Peiyang,
with the title of First Lord.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
You may run three laps around the Palace.
His Majesty allows you to also fly a kite.
It's flying!
Flying...
Your Majesty,
Look!
It's airborne!
Don't be scared. This is outrageous!
We still have a proclamation to make...
Don't force him to be Emperor,
we only want to be safe.
Traitor!
I, Tuan Ch'i-jui, Premier of the Republic of China
and Commander-in-Chief of the expedition force,
hereby condemn Chang Hsun and his clique
for forcibly dissolving the Senate,
holding the President hostage
and restoring monarchy.
Such action is contemptible
and against the will of the people and Heaven.
I, Tuan Ch'i-jui,
resuming as Premier on President Li's instruction
will lead a punitive expedition
to crush the traitors.
July 2, this 6th year of the Republic.
It's time for us students to take action.
Go to Peking and rally against the restoration.
I don't understand.
About what?
By conceding the presidency to Yuan
the Senate has made a fatal error.
The problem with China
is not just about choosing the wrong President!
Isn't that a reason?
If all fault lies with the head of state,
then the problems we had before
were Yuan Shih-k'ai's fault.
But what about the restoration fiasco?
Who should we blame?
What are you getting at?
Today's China
cannot be changed by having a
different Emperor or President.
An utmost humiliation!
The Chinese race has been shamed!
Republic is a must and demanded by the people.
Yet in a mere six years,
we already have two emperors.
Remember, China is a republic,
to have an emperor in a republic
is so utterly ironic.
Bravo!
The Republic champions freedom,
equality and philanthropy.
Yet, since the founding of the Republic,
equality has been ignored, freedom trampled on,
philanthropy does not exist.
Lives were lost and blood was shed
in exchange for a republic in name only.
That is intolerable!
Is this the Republic
people have sacrificed for?
It is unacceptable legally and to the Assembly,
and to the 400 million Chinese subjects.
Down with Chang Hsun!
Down with P'u-yi!
Down with Chang Hsun!
Down with P'u-yi!
Down with Chang Hsun! Down with P'u-yi!
Despite the 1 91 1 Revolution
and the rallying cry for the Republic,
people still worship Confucius
without learning the essence of democratic freedom.
Looking back over history for the past decades,
each time there's a failed republican movement,
monarchism will make another comeback.
Just like Yuan and Chang's attempts to restore.
Fellow students!
Feudalism and the republic are incompatible.
To keep one, the other must be destroyed.
In order for this country to be strong,
we must first remove this ancient burden
from the hearts of the people.
You're shamelessly boastful, Mr. Ch'en.
You praise New Culture and bury the old
and blame all our troubles on Confucianism.
What did Confucius do 2,000 years ago
that is damaging today?
Mr. Ku, as an erudite scholar,
can't you see what Confucius advocated then
is not applicable to us today?
What Confucius taught us
is like arithmetics.
2,000 years ago, 3 x 3 = 9. It still is today.
It will never be 8.
Blaming your miscalculations
on the person who invented arithmetics is absurd.
If you call that New Culture, it's bullshit.
Clearly a talent despite his quibbling!
Culture needs reforms
to keep up with time.
Some say classical Chinese is refined
while vernacular Chinese is vulgar.
But imperial examination system was harmful.
Even the best written eight-legged essays
were detached from society and impractical.
They're useless except in examinations.
Our country needs talents,
pragmatism will make us strong.
I represent the Women's College of Education,
I think classical Chinese is more concise.
That's a fact!
Please cite an example.
Take the phrase "unable to do it"
Isn't it more concise in classical Chinese?
That's four words.
You use only three in vernacular Chinese.
Such as?
"Can't be done!"
Bravo!
Before the 1 91 1 Revolution,
we modelled after Japan.
But it doesn't appear to be working.
Japan's Meiji Restoration was inspired by the West.
Why don't we learn from the teacher
but choose to follow the student?
It's not about Japanese or Americans.
It's a matter of new versus old culture.
To strengthen the country and enlighten its people,
we must abolish the old and popularize the new.
That's how our nation can be re-born.
Who should we learn from?
Whether it's the U.S., France
Japan, or even Russia.
- Learn from whoever can help China.
- Russia?
That's absurd!
The governance of any country in the world
is a way of thinking that stems
from its own culture.
Look at the world,
taking a macro view of the future of humanity,
is not absurd at all.
There's a man in Russia called Lenin,
who succeeded with the Bolshevik revolution.
The ideology he introduced
is Marxism from Germany.
What is Bolshevik?
Bolshevik means majority.
What is majority? Peasants and workers.
The many millions of oppressed labourers.
The success of Russia
is a victory for Bolshevism,
common people and the proletariat,
for the first time ever in the history of mankind,
and also the greatest.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Peiyang is up for grabs after Yuan's death.
Tuan Ch'i-jui used Chang Hsun
to get rid of Li Yuan-hung,
then he took out Chang Hsun.
Now he's using Wu P'ei-fu against Dr. Sun.
There's no end to this war.
If this continues, Hu'nan will be in ruins.
What about the Constitutional Protection Movement?
To succeed, Dr. Sun must launch
a northern expedition,
and Hu'nan will bear the brunt.
KMT should be stronger than the Peiyang Clique.
By some distance.
But in-fighting among various factions
makes KMT vulnerable.
What's your view?
Declare Hu'nan autonomous.
Sir...
Sir...
He's in a bad mood, I'm so sorry.
First the south, then the north.
Now it's north against south! There's no end to it!
There's no end to this revolution
You-jen, what are we missing?
Madam, same as before,
no money, no guns, no troops.
Fellow students,
I believe France is the hub
of European civilisation,
the standard-bearer of modern revolution,
and a model for global revolution.
Then let's go to France.
But...
to go abroad
we need money.
We'll raise it.
Let's split up,
Peking, Shanghai and Canton.
Tse-tung, where do you want to go?
Peking.
Peking?
I can visit Mr. Yang at Peking University.
Which faculty are you from?
My name is Mao Tse-tung, sir, graduate of
First Provincial Normal School of Hu'nan.
I'm visiting, came across your class,
and took the liberty of sitting in.
Mr. Mao, not that I won't let you,
but Peking University has its rules.
I'm a great admirer of yours,
I only wish to sit in for one session.
I'll leave quietly afterwards.
Take a seat.
Thank you.
The university is not a sanctuary,
anyone not properly dressed won't be admitted.
That's the rule here!
In any case,
because of Hu Shih's huge reputation
I don't want to miss his lecture.
What brings you to Peking?
To raise money for my alumni to go to France.
Ta-chao.
This student of mine...
what should we do with him?
You're...
Mr. Li Ta-chao?
I need an assistant.
Are you willing to work hard?
Absolutely!
I'll do anything anytime.
8 silver dollars a month.
That's plenty.
More than I make as a soldier.
You're a soldier?
Yes, but never went to war.
Close the door, thank you.
You are...
It's me!
K'ai-hui!
Today, we leave for the Paris Peace Conference.
For the first time in 1 00 years,
China shows up on international stage as a victor.
We won't let our nation down!
Let's brace ourselves
and demand for the return of Shantung.
Unite...
and China shall prevail!
Justice shall prevail!
Look! Behind us
are 400 million Chinese.
But a weak nation lacks diplomatic clout.
We shall join you in Paris later.
My words carry little weight,
but I'll do my best for the Republic.
Unite...
Justice shall prevail!
Sir, I once thought
our nation can be saved by strong mind and body,
or even by Kropotkin's anarchism.
But these solutions now seem superficial.
I read your review on Marxism
I think that is the truth.
My article is a mere glimpse of Marxism.
It's a fraction of what it is about.
You should study "The Communist Manifesto"
and its theory of a proletariat revolution.
That's the truth.
"The Communist Manifesto"
I forgot today is New Year's eve.
Stay for dinner.
Sir!
I still have work to do.
It's dad's prescribed hours!
We can now eat New Year dinner.
Great!
Wipe your hands!
Victory of the common people?
Didn't Uncle Li write this?
Yes, it's about the Russian revolution.
How is it different?
Most revolutions are led by the elite.
But in Mr. Li's thesis,
Russian revolution is a victory
of the common people.
Common people?
Let's have a drink.
I don't drink.
Just one, for the New Year.
Alright.
Let's go watch the fireworks.
Hurry up!
Coming...
Shantung is the cradle of Chinese civilisation,
great thinkers like Confucius and Mencius
were born in Shantung.
China cannot lose Shantung,
Iike the West can't be without Jerusalem.
Concerning the problem of Shantung,
the governments have already
signed a treaty of 21 Articles.
So it is not necessary to discuss
it in this conference.
At the Paris Peace Conference,
Japan proposed that German concessions in Shantung
should be transferred to them permanently.
As expected.
Hu Shih and I
intend to write to President Wilson,
and force him to mediate.
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.
That's Yang's student, Mao Tse-tung.
Tse-tung, please come down.
Japan's ambition in China
is clearly a threat to American interests.
Wilson must do something.
Mr. Ch'en,
if Japan refuses to withdraw its troops,
will the U.S. send its fleet
to Kiautschou Bay for us?
So Wilson's Fourteen-Points
is bullshit?
He's right. Between Japan and China,
the Powers can only choose to support one.
They have never backed us in the past.
They supported Japan
because they wanted her to contain Russia.
They need to contain Russia now more than ever,
don't they?
Thank you, comrades!
Sending you to Peking
is to raise money,
but you spent your time reading in the library.
He's a genuine bookworm.
We can't go to France without money.
Going back to Hu'nan empty handed
is so humiliating.
A cashier's cheque
for 20,000 silver dollars!
Where did you get this?
Chang Shih-chao raised it at Mr. Yang's request.
Mao Tse-tung...
You left me speechless!
Do I have to pay it back?
Of course!
I'm going back to Hu'nan tonight
to make plans for France.
I need to stay on for a while.
You're not going?
Are you courting each other?
I have to go now!
Money!
Do you have to go?
I made a promise.
Will you come back?
Of course, the reason why I'm going
is to bring back more advanced learnings.
Mr. Yang is here,
Mr. Li, too,
and...
you.
Before I leave, I want to visit my parents.
If you don't come back,
I'll look for you in France.
Bad news from Paris!
We just got word,
the person who signed the loan agreement
with Japan last September
was Chang Tsung-hsiang, our envoy to Japan.
Chang Tsung-hsiang!
Traitor!
Something tumultuous is about to happen.
Because of the Peace Conference?
Yes!
If we succeed, the nation will rejoice.
If we fail...
Nationalism suppressed for centuries
will erupt like a volcano.
What should we do?
Just go with the flow.
We'll turn this world upside down.
Extra! Diplomatic failure in Paris!
Extra! Paris peace talk collapses...
Today,
Japan's conspiracy to take over Shantung
is about to succeed
due to our diplomatic failure.
If Shantung were taken by Japan,
our territorial integrity will be compromised,
and the nation will perish.
What should we do now?
Stage protests at foreign legation.
Calm down!
Don't lose sight of our objective!
We just want to be patriotic.
We're doing this to pressure
the Peiyang government.
Reclaim our sovereignty in Shandong.
All along,
we deluded ourselves into thinking
when the war is over
the Western Powers will help us.
Now we know
we have been betrayed
by the rhetoric of politicians at Versailles,
by the Western Powers
who are too busy carving up Europe to care.
And our government
had wanted to sign this humiliating treaty.
A historic moment is upon us.
Fellow students, take to the streets!
Return Tsingtao!
Defend our sovereignty!
Return Tsingtao!
Defend our sovereignty!
Return Tsingtao!
This is Wilson's so-called truth and justice!
The Western Powers betrayed us in Paris.
They betrayed China!
Betrayed 400 million Chinese!
Betrayed truth and justice!
Something so painfully obvious
but overlooked by the Peiyang government!
This Peiyang government
that can tolerate such humiliation
is not fit to govern us!
They are Western Powers' accomplices,
running dogs of the Japanese pirates!
In time of crisis, stand up and be counted!
Today, we want an eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth!
President Wilson is a scoundrel!
He deceived us!
He insulted us!
He toyed with us!
What should we do now?
Fellow countrymen,
Today, we shall petition President Hsu
and also the Premier.
We want people to know about the Paris conspiracy.
We want them to know our demands.
Whoever it is
who tries to wipe us out
will face a bloody battle!
Pay with blood!
Fight to the end!
Return Tsingtao!
Today's rally
is a harbinger of China's bright future.
So, this very moment, this very day...
I'm proud and honoured to be a part of
this unprecedented revolution.
Return our sovereignty!
Punish the traitors!
Students have taken to the streets,
they're heading for the Legation Quarter.
Ignorant, naive and stupid!
Send police to stop them!
Yes, sir!
Fight to the end!
Patriotism is not a crime!
Fight to the end!
Patriotism is not a crime!
Fight to the end!
Fellow students!
T'an Ssu-t'ung said
"successful reforms come with bloodshed",
So let bloodshed and sacrifice begin with us!
Charge!
Come out!
Young lady!
Take your grievances to the prosecutors!
You've come to the wrong place!
My grievances are beyond the prosecutors!
What do you mean?
I'm pleading for 400 million Chinese.
Come out!
Return Tsingtao!
Hand over the traitors!
Return Tsingtao!
Hand over the traitors!
Return Tsingtao!
Hand over the traitors!
Charge!
Charge!
Go inside and grab the traitors!
Open up...
Open the door!
We were under siege in Japan,
it's happening here as well!
Don't cry!
Look, Ping-hsiang!
Don't worry, I'm here.
3 Bamboos!
K'uang Hu-sheng, bravo!
Jump!
Jump inside!
Soldiers!
Teng Chung-hsia, Fang Ho!
Go, Fang Ho!
1...2...3...
1...2...3...
Quiet...
You should be fighting Japanese in Shantung
instead of guarding a traitor's house.
Comrades! Brothers...
We're one family!
I believe we're one family,
Those you're holding off
are your brothers and sisters.
Each and every one a patriotic student.
Move aside, let us through!
Protect our territory!
Protect our sovereignty!
Brothers!
Everyone of you is patriotic
Am I right?
Yes!
Are you Chinese?
Yes!
Then let us through!
Charge!
Students!
Tell me where he is!
Hand over the traitor!
Search the house! Step aside...
Students...
Listen, harbouring traitors
makes you also a traitor of China.
He's here!
Students!
I have nothing to do with it!
Where is Chang Tsung-hsiang?
I don't know!
Take him away!
Listen...
This is the desk on which the treaty was signed!
Burn it...
The police are here!
Are you Ts'ao Ju-lin?
No, I am not...
- No? Then who are you? - I'm really nobody,
just a visiting guest.
Where did they go?
They left.
How could you! That's Chang Tsung-hsiang!
After him...
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Consider China's 2,000-year-old history,
have you ever heard of
students involved in arson and killing?
They have no choice but to revolt.
Today...
President Hsu has arrested innocent students.
He did it to please our enemies.
As a staff member of the school,
I declare the school will go on strike
until the students are released.
Long live students...
Long live revolution...
What is it?
You wrote "The spirit of the Chinese People"
and I admired you for it.
Speaking of principles,
you should know our differences with foreigners.
But today,
you wrote in a Japanese-owned newspaper
denouncing the students as barbaric mobsters!
What has happened to your principles?
You're siding with the enemy.
Students, workers and merchants are all on strike.
Overnight, the whole country is in uproar.
Even soldiers are siding with the students.
This is a crucial moment, no compromise!
We mustn't go against the tide.
Tu-hsiu, what is it?
Have we won already?
Is this time for celebration?
Ridiculous!
Mr. Hu,
are you denouncing Ch'en Tu-hsiu and Li Ta-chao?
Why not?
You must have a sound argument.
Marx's doctrine is just a theory.
But such a theory
though proven successful in Russia
does not mean it's applicable in China.
We must not act like a parrot
and lose ourselves by following others.
To sit back and talk about theories
without solving the actual problems
is no different from Confucianism.
If this is what New Culture is about,
then it's meaningless.
For Ch'en and Li to model on Russia,
it's not going to solve our problems.
You're wrong, sir.
Confucianism is a feudal code,
Whereas Marx's doctrine is scientific.
You can't compare the two.
Esteemed delegates,
what right do you have to give Shantung to Japan?
I am furious.
Chinese people will never forget this painful day.
You wouldn't dare to kill Ch'en Tu-hsiu!
If he dies, there'll be hundreds more like him.
Tell Hsu not to make himself a public enemy.
If he still wants to continue as President,
he must release Ch'en Tu-hsiu at once.
You have suffered, Tu-hsiu.
Ch'en Tu-hsiu takes on the burden alone,
and sets an example for us all.
Peking University is proud of him.
Bravo, Mr. Ch'en!
So sorry...
- Over here! - What took you so long?
We got lost!
- Hello! - We'll do the introductions later,
Iet's get on board.
Come on...
Let's go!
Wait...
I'm thinking...
transplanting the experience of
a foreign revolution
does it really work?
Changed your mind again?
China has much more complex issues,
I'd better stay.
Good luck all... Till we meet again.
Give me some money!
Who is he?
Mao Tse-tung from Hu'nan.
What a shame he's not going!
Why did the Governor shut down the
"Shian Kian Review"?
Because we told the truth.
He's afraid the truth will come out
about Chang Ching-yao being Hu'nan's public enemy.
Workers, peasants and merchants have all suffered.
Fellow workers, Hu'nan will not tolerate Chang!
Hu'nan is finished with him around.
We're only poor workers
we have no say.
How do you write the word "work"?
A vertical stroke between 2 lines.
Yes, heaven above your head
with your feet on the ground.
The words "work" and "man" together
make the word "heaven".
It means the world under heaven.
Workers and peasants will rule the world.
Sounds too good to be true.
This is not my idea,
it belongs to a foreigner called Marx.
This foreigner advocated
equality of all men.
Adopting this theory,
the Russian workers now rule their own country.
Fellow workers, the revolution Marx spoke
of will be universal.
Chinese workers should follow suit.
Overthrow this corrupt and evil government
that bullied and oppressed us.
Yes...
Tse-tung, your telegram.
Tse-tung...
the doctor said dad had a stroke,
he can't talk, he can't hear.
His health has deteriorated so much in a year...
Before taken ill,
dad hadn't stopped speaking of you.
Remember...
the summer of 1 91 5
you asked me a question?
All these years,
I've been thinking hard.
I'm close to having an answer.
But...
Sir...
Dad...
As my wife,
Iife will be tough.
If you're with me,
you won't enjoy a stable life,
no bridal gowns, sedan chair or banquet.
Not even a witness or marriage license.
I'm willing.
The Governor wishes to meet your representatives.
Follow me!
Let them go!
You have no right to arrest us!
What are you doing? Let go!
What do you want?
Let go of me!
Let us out!
In this world,
who are the noblest people?
My answer to that...
is the working class.
Food, clothes, and even houses that we live in
are all created by workers.
We slave for a living,
but we're not well fed, clothed or sheltered.
Is that fair?
No!
Of course not!
That's why we must unite
and go on strike.
Confront these bourgeois factory owners
and show them our strength.
Reclaim what is rightfully ours.
Fellow workers,
in the future
workers will rule the world.
Long live workers!
Release the students!
Sir, these students haven't eaten in 3 days.
Who's not eating?
Let him starve to death!
He has no one but himself to blame.
Who wrote this?
I did.
These are our latest demands.
The hunger strike continues until they are met.
We want books and newspapers.
- Go ahead. - Yes!
We want New Year dinner.
I'll treat all 26 of you to dinner!
We'll even eat outside.
The Awakening Society needs a place to study.
Certainly.
What's your name?
Chou En-lai.
Why did you change your mind?
Didn't we agree to go on hunger strike?
Change of tactics.
Let's prepare for a long struggle!
Let's eat.
Goodbye!
Mr. Ch'en!
"Cops are after you, follow the student, Li Ta-chao"
Follow me!
If you leave Peking while on bail
and get arrested again,
it'll be difficult to get out.
I'll go back to Shanghai.
Scholars-in-arms are hopeless.
Don't say that!
Your arrest has shaken the nation.
That's as big an honour as you can get!
What are you studying these days?
The Russian Revolution.
Hu Shih was right about you!
The Russian Revolution is all you care about.
It's the last resort when all else have failed.
Now tell me,
why model after Russia?
The reason why the Russians succeeded
was because the Bolsheviks
united the workers and peasants,
the broadest social classes.
To unite the nation, you must first
unite peasants and workers.
To unite them,
China must first have its own Bolshevik.
Tu-hsiu, when you get to Shanghai,
that's exactly what you've to do.
We'll split up, you take the north, I go south,
form our own political party at once.
Easy...
When I get to Shanghai,
I'll send you your favourite candy.
You must keep your word!
Take care!
Take care!
We should help China
build her own Bolshevik Party.
The committee nominates Maring to assist.
Excellent, go right away!
Bravo!
What does the Shanghai dispatch say?
Each region should send two delegates
to the congress,
and the caucuses in Japan and Europe
will each send one delegate.
Peking, Shanghai, Canton,
Ch'ang-sha, Wuhan and Tsinan
will all be represented.
You and Ch'en Kung-po will represent Canton.
You two will represent Peking.
Remember,
you're there as my personal representative.
Aren't you attending?
The Comintern is attaching great importance to it.
If neither you nor Mr. Ch'en attend,
what's the point of having the congress?
Apologise to Comrade Maring for me.
Students are borrowing more books
for summer vacation.
I can't leave as Head Librarian.
I disagree with the Comintern on many issues,
if we argue during the congress
there will be no way back.
I see.
Remember,
Ch'en Tu-hsiu and I must act in unanimity.
I understand.
This should be enough for a month,
when you get to Shanghai, spend when you have to.
Dad left this,
you have it.
No, you keep it.
Don't be late for the congress.
No!
Just take it.
I'm leaving,
take good care of yourself.
Let me introduce myself,
Chang Kuo-t'ao from Peking.
Liu Jen-ching, also from Peking.
I'm Li Han-chun from Shanghai.
Li Ta from Shanghai.
Teng En-ming from Tsinan.
Wang Chin-mei from Tsinan.
Tung Pi-wu from Wuhan.
Ch'en Tan-ch'iu from Wuhan.
Chou Fo-hai from Japan.
Pao Hui-seng, representing Ch'en Tu-hsiu.
Nice to meet you.
Ho Shu-heng from Chang-sha.
- This comrade from Chang-sha is...
- Tse-tung,
it's been a while.
Indeed, Kuo-t'ao.
My apologies, gentlemen...
Sorry for being late.
Hello, everyone.
I'm Ch'en Kung-po from Canton.
Who's the lovely lady?
My wife.
Greetings, I'm Li Li-chuang.
But we can't accommodate a couple...
I'm sorry...
We've a room at Tatung Hotel across the street.
Bringing your spouse to the congress?
Everyone...
This is my wife, Wang Hui-wu.
I'm working the reception.
Look for me if you need anything.
We've all had long trips, get some rest.
Meet at my brother's place tomorrow.
1 06 rue Wantz.
I'm most honoured
to represent Ch'en Tu-hsiu and Li Ta-chao
to chair the First National Congress.
Let me introduce to you
Comrade Maring,
an observer from Comintern.
Mao Tse-tung will be our secretary.
The first item on the agenda
is to decide on the name of the party.
Our view regarding the name of the party
is clear-cut.
From the "The Communist Manifesto",
we adopt the word "Communist"
and call it the Chinese Communist Party.
In his letter to Tse-tung,
Ts'ai Ho-san is also in favour.
Maring wants to know Li Ta-chao's view.
Mr. Li's preference is
Chinese Communist Party.
I agree.
Agreed.
Agreed.
Unanimously passed.
Rickshaw-man,
Tung Fang Hotel on Nanking Road.
Let's go to Palace Hotel instead.
We're switching hotels?
We're being followed.
Be careful, don't look around.
Palace Hotel.
Got it!
Is there another exit?
There's a back entrance for the staff.
Wait for us there in five minutes.
Sure!
Why are we being followed everywhere?
I'm sorry, sir.
The first floor is full,
is the second floor alright?
Alright!
Jump!
Stupid idiots...
Go look for them!
Find them in three days or else!
Sir, my brother is with the Green Gang
finding someone in Shanghai is a piece of cake.
The Peking caucus has 1 3 members,
including Li Ta-chao, Chang Kuo-t'ao,
Lo Zhang-lung, Liu Jen-ch'ing,
Ch'en Te-jung, Teng Chung-hsia,
Kao Chun-yu, Miu Po-ying, Ho Meng-hsiung,
Chu Wu-shan, Fan Hung-chieh, Wu Ju-ming.
Heads up, everyone!
A draft platform of the CCP
is hereby pronounced
for delegates to comment and discuss.
Proletariat must join force
with the revolutionary army
and overthrow the bourgeois regime;
they must help the working class
until the class system is abolished,
and until the class struggle has ended.
Meaning, when class system is finally abolished,
a proletariat dictatorship will be established.
Liaise with the Comintern,
and adopt the Soviet model.
Unite workers, peasants and soldiers
and adopt social revolution as our goal.
Those who accept the Party's platform and policies,
and willing to be loyal members,
upon the introduction of a Party member,
regardless of gender and nationality
can be admitted as Party members
and become our comrades.
But...
before their initiation into the Party,
they must sever all ties
with other parties and organisations
whose platforms are contradictory to ours.
Tomorrow is the last day of the congress,
the main agenda
is to adopt the platform
and election of the Central Committee.
Comrades Maring and Nikolsky
will attend tomorrow's closing session.
Rickshaw!
Sorry, we had to make a detour.
Is everyone here?
Chou Fo-hai is in the toilet,
he'll be right back.
It's that Chou again!
Let's not wait.
The draft platform we tabled yesterday,
can continue to be discussed now.
I have a comment.
Regarding nationality...
Can I help you?
Looking for someone?
What do you want?
Who are you looking for?
Chairman Wang of the Social League.
There's no Social League
or Chairman Wang.
I'm sorry...
Maring calls for an immediate recess.
I agree with Comrade Maring.
Let's adjourne.
This is my home. What are you doing here?
Why do you organise meeting in your house?
What meeting? I was entertaining guests.
That two are from which country?
Which two?
The two foreigners.
They're Dutch.
Pack up and be ready to move out!
Sir.
What do you do for a living?
Professor.
Him?
My colleague.
Today I can close your house and catch your people.
Because you are teaching in university,
I'll let you free.
If not, you will burn yourself.
I won't.
How is it?
It's fine.
Comrade Maring said we must leave Shanghai.
I suggest we go to Chiahsing
rent a boat for the meeting.
Is Maring coming?
He's too obvious a target,
for our safety, he's not going.
Alright!
What time do we leave?
There's a train tomorrow at 1 0:00am.
Does Ch'en Kung-po know?
I'll go get him tomorrow morning.
Are you under surveillance?
Probably not, it was an accident.
Let's go home.
The meeting is not yet over.
To form a national party with just 50 people,
this has to be a joke!
A gun!
Don't stare!
Homicide at Tatung Hotel!
Tatung Hotel?
That's where Ch'en Kung-po stays!
Kung-po left for Kwangtung already.
Yesterday two people died at their hotel.
His wife was petrified. So they left.
It was a lovers' suicide pact!
Cowards!
Let's go.
Comrades, we have reached the critical hours.
The last item on the agenda,
is to elect the Party Central Committee.
Under democratic principles,
we shall vote for
members of the Central Committee.
We should have 1 3 delegates,
but only 12 are in attendance.
After the vote,
Ch'en Tu-hsiu, Chang Kuo-t'ao and Li Ta
are elected Central Committee members,
Ch'en Tu-hsiu is named General Secretary.
Meeting is concluded.
Comrades,
I'd like to recite from "The Communist Manifesto"
to illustrate my thrill and excitement.
The Communists disdain to conceal
their aims and views.
They openly declare
that their ends can be attained
only by the forcible overthrow
of all existing social conditions.
Let the ruling classes tremble
at a communist revolution.
The proletarians have nothing to lose
but their chains.
They have a world to win.
Proletarians of all countries, unite.
Proletarians of all countries, unite.
Proletarians of all countries, unite...
Proletarians of all countries...
...unite

Director Chen, it appears
you will kiss and make up with the CPC.
You don't approve?
You don't know the CPC
like we do.
While you were making passes at them,
we fought them head on
in France.
I heard you intend to resign.
Even if you resign,
wait till after the capitulation ceremony in Nanjing
You helped defeat the Japanese.
The ceremony needs a national hero like you.
If I don't resign,
I'll be blamed for the civil war.
Welcome, Mr. Mao
Welcome to Chongqing, Mr. Mao.
We've been fighting the enemy
for 8 years.
It's my job
to fight till the end.
Now that we won,
why
are we stilling fighting?
I will not
fight my own kind.
General Malinovsky has agreed
to hand over the Northeast provinces.
No need to fight anymore?
If we don't,
will the CPC hand over their turf?
Ladies and gentlemen.
Chairman Chiang and Mr. Mao propose a toast
To peace, cheers.
Cheers.
Chairman Chiang.
Hello, Chairman Chiang
Hello, Mr. Mao.
I'm from the "Central Daily".
I notice you're both wearing Mandarin suit.
On a special day like today,
is there a special meaning for that?
The Mandarin suit
is the official attire for all civil servants of the Nationalist Government.
As the Chairman
of KMT,
it's my duty
to welcome Mr. Mao to Chongqing.
I'm wearing the Mandarin suit out of respect.
Mr Mao, is that your reason too?
The reason is simple
Chairman Chiang and I are both Dr. Sun's disciples.
Both the KMT and the CPC have inherited
Dr. Sun's revolutionary legacy.
We share the same roots.
It is only natural that
Dr. Sun's disciples should wear the Mandarin suits
Mr. Mao. Excuse me.
Pardon me, Mr Mao.
To see you standing next to each other,
I can't help but feel excited
I have another question for Mr. Mao
In the upcoming negotiation
ith regards to the issue of democracy,
will the Parties find common ground
or reach any consensus?
Definitely, if you look hard enough.
This reporter already noticed
we had something in common.
The North China division of the CPC
and the Shandong division
are infiltrating the Northeast
Chen Yi's New Fourth Army
is active around Shanghai and Hangzhou,
making it difficult for the Nationalist Government to move the capital back to Nanjing.
Our troops are too far away from these regions.
The Americans have landed in Qingdao.
They promised to send planes and warships
to get our troops to the Northeast, North China,
East China and south of Yangtze River
General Du, I'm counting on you in the Northeast
Master Zhang, please give us your honest opinion.
The CPC
likes to keep things in the open.
We never hide our views
and respect those of our friends and the China Democratic League.
Sir?
Thank you.
I'll be honest with you, as a friend.
To form a democratic coalition government,
peace and unity are the only ways forward.
If Mr. Chiang and Mr. Mao can sit down and talk,
it would be wonderful
A negotiation requires concessions and compromises
in order to bring about peace
Chairman Mao came to Chongqing
That alone proves our sincerity.
The turf and army are minor details.
Rather than haggle over them,
why not unify all the parties?
At this moment,
the Nationalist Army is busy
in regions where we have set up our regime
with strategic blockades or explorative attacks.
The Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army
are thorns in Mr. Chiang's flesh.
Pardon me for saying this
If we didn't have a few hundred thousand used guns,
Mr. Chiang would never sit down and talk to us.
Ze
If neither Party let go,
the war will go on.
You can forget about peace.
If neither Party gives in,
negotiation will break down.
I appreciate
your mediation.
Very well.
For the sake of peace and democracy,
we'll make the first concession
Among the 100 divisions of the national defense army,
our request for 48 divisions
has been cut back to 20 divisions
We're willing to give up 8 liberated regions
in south of Yangtze River.
I hope that our concession
will set the consultative meeting in motion
and help set up a coalition government.
I'm here on behalf of President Truman and the United States government
to issue the following statement.
We have no intention to support
a Cream of Wheat" Marxist to take over China.
The present Nationalist Government of China and Mr. Chiang Kai-shek
are faithful friends of the United States.
Our only concern is
whether the Yalta Conference and
the Sino-Russian Friendship Alliance Treaty
will be honored and implemented by the Chongqing government.
The United States is cognizant that
the Nationalist government of China is a one-party government
and believes that peace, unity and democratic reform in China
can be furthered if the basis of this government
is broadened to include
other political elements in the country.
On behalf of the CPC, I wish to issue the following statement.
We welcome President Truman's China policy as per the declaration on the 15th
with regards to the cease fire
between the KMT, CPC
and other political parties
and to call upon a multi-party meeting
to implement reforms
to end the KMT's one-party dictatorship
and to ensure fair and
effective representation of all parties
to facilitate the democratic unification of China.
President Truman's special envoy,
Marshall, is arriving soon
to mediate in the civil war.
Don't slight him.
Peace or war,
you should know better.
Stop when we want to stop
Fight when we want to fight.
This is the only case.
Not until we say so.
The purpose of this Assembly
is to seek political reforms towards democracy.
The basis of our negotiation
is to establish a multi-party coalition government
to facilitate a peaceful unification.
Kai,
there are over 30 seats in the Senate.
We have to give up 8 of them?
To give up 8 seats
is to oust 8 of our men
and hand them to someone else
Who owns the world now? It's hardly KMT.
Father
Central Club and the others have secretly agreed
not to acknowledge the CPPCC
and refused to give up their seats for the CDL and CPC.
There'II be trouble
if they keep this up.
Fellow students, teachers
and friends of Sichuan.
5 months ago, we gathered here
to celebrate a national victory.
That's outrageous. Lower your whip.
Mind your own business.
She's my girl.
You have no say
Whoever feeds her,
owns her
Hey Stop it.
Are you alright, Miss?
Who fired that shot? Who was it?
Who was it? Who fired that shot?
Sir.
No open fire in the city, Sir.
But they can beat people up?
I don't care who you work for.
Send a message for me.
Don't sneak around.
Stop this underhanded nonsense
Extra: Mr. Chiang calls for a meeting.
Newspaper.
Here
Chiang has taken the gloves off.
He's calling the National People's Congress without us.
It's his one-man show.
The sooner we set the date for the NPC,
the sooner the US will confirm their assistance.
We can't have the NPC with the KMT alone.
We can forget the CPC.
For appearance, we still have the other parties
The CPC and the other parties
insisted on implementing the resolution of the CPPCC in Chongqing.
What will you do?
Pacify Zhang Lan.
Coax and fight the CPC at the same time.
When Mao runs out of troops,
we can stop coaxing.
4 days ago in Kunming, Mr. Li Gongpu
was murdered by secret agents of the KMT.
What crime has he committed to deserve such a fate?
He used his pen and he spoke up.
Everything he wrote and said
was precisely what any Chinese with a conscience
should write and speak of.
What a shame.
The counter-revolutionaries' shame
is precisely Mr. Li's honor
His blood will not be shed in vain
Mr Li gave up his life
There's a price to be paid for his life.
Justice will prevail,
because truth will prevail
We want democracy, not civil war.
Tell him I went out.
Sir.
The Chairman is not here for real.
He sent me on an overseas expedition.
I came to say goodbye to my sworn brother.
But he's not here
Vice President, why the lantern?
It's broad daylight.
Daylight?
I see only darkness.
I can't see without a lantern.
You must be kidding, Sir.
I'm not in the mood
"The Three Principles of the People" is the cornerstone of our Party
If he's bent on having his way,
the days of our Party are numbered.
That's all I have to say.
Tell him to take care
Zhangjiakou is the capital of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region,
it's also the only major city under the CPC
that has an arsenal that's crucial to them.
But it'll be returned to the Nationalist Government soon.
General, are you saying
the manufacturing and military base of the CPC
doesn't exist any more?
I admire Mao for never giving up.
But talk is cheap
and you can't just work your finger to the bone
Power is everything.
According to you,
the Communist Party is doomed to fail this time?
I didn't say that
I'll make you a wager.
The CPC wins,
I'm willing to hold Mao's horsewhip.
20 years ago,
we surrendered our arms
for peace.
What happened? We got a massacre in return,
not peace.
We learn from our mistakes
For peace,
for our future and to eliminate war.
In this war imposed on us by our enemies,
we must retaliate.
Within 3 months of the closing of this NPC,
our government
will put an end to this civil war.
We will annihilate the separatist regime by force of arms
to bring forth a unified country
and bring peace to our nation.
Some say the evacuation from Yan'an
marks a major setback in the Chinese Revolution.
If this is a setback,
our party and this army
have survived countless setbacks.
You keep the land and lose the people, you lose both.
You keep the people and lose the land, you have both
I'll trade Yan'an for the whole of China.
We came all this way
but we're still one step away from peace
What a shame to give it up
Mao was right: Without guns in their hands,
Chiang will never negotiate with us
The CDL served as mediator between the KMT and CPC.
But Chiang is insatiable.
The CPC gave up their turf,
but they did not get the peace they wanted.
Some guarantor I am.
Chiang wants a one-party NPC.
If neither the CPC or CDL shows up,
we'll be handing the regime to him.
Don't be stupid
We'll fall into his trap if we show up.
Our position is clear.
Only a coalition government is legal
There'll be no NPC without peace
and no coalition government without political consultancy.
You're saying...
We side with the CPC
I, Zhang Lan,
will not attend Chiang's NPC.
Based on the experience of the Northeast Bureau,
we implement land reforms in the countryside.
The results are quite obvious.
Stay off the main road, take the vicinity of the city,
give the land to the farmers.
We'll take over when those who plough the land can own it
The supplies unit got separated.
We have problems with food and clothes.
Zedong.
Mr. Chairman.
I need to write an editorial for the Xinhua News Agency.
I need the rest of this candle for later
But we're having a meeting.
Precisely, just keep talking.
You don't need to see anything
Groping in the dark?
Let's get back to business.
Chiang threw caution to the wind and declared war.
Bullets don't have eyes.
In my opinion,
Enlai, Bishi and I
will form a front committee and stay in Shanbei
Shaoqi, you and Zhu De form a Central Working Committee
and cross the Yellow River into North China.
We'll work from both sides
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
Keep them separate.
We'II still have the other when one is crushed
Hurry. Get out
Get rid of everyone inside.
Seal up this place
That son of a bitch
He had the audacity to seize the CDL headquarters
and restrict our activities.
Li Jishen and He Xiangning
set up the Revolutionary Committee of the KMT in Hong Kong.
Founding members such as Feng Yuxiang and Cai Tingkai
have indicated their intention to break away from Chiang
The KMT is splitting up.
You should leave for Hong Kong right away
We'll re-open the CDL headquarters in Hong Kong
But...
I'm all for it
We must not miss this chance.
I hereby announce
the results of the first presidential election of the Republic of China
with the following votes:
Chiang Kai-shek 2, 430 votes;
Ju Zheng 269 votes.
According to the constitution of the ROC and electoral law,
I hereby announce
Mr. Chiang Kai-shek is elected first President of the ROC
Congratulations.
Congrats
Hu Zongnan wired. We lost Yan'an
Chiang Kai-shek was elected President in Nanjing.
Long live Mao Zedong in the valley.
Nothing to brag about
Get rid of the 'Iong live' in clause 23 of the slogan.
Let Chiang be the emperor.
I won't join his party
Clause 5,
mere mention of the working class is inappropriate.
We have insisted on a coalition government
It's bad to sing a different tune.
I agree with the amendments.
Let's have a show of hands
Go on air with this.
Xinhua Radio broadcasts
the CPC slogan for Labor Day on May 1.
First, this year's Labor Day
is the day the Chinese people head towards victory.
Second, this year's Labor Day
is the day the Chinese people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek
meets his doom.
Fifth, all democratic parties and organizations
should immediately call for the CPPCC
to discuss and elect delegates
to set up a coalition government.
The CPC made an excellent move
You're the chess expert.
This time you must make up your mind.
It's easier said than done.
It'll depend on the CPC's next move
I heard Li Zongren had invited you to Nanjing.
Chiang wants you too.
Li Zongren.
Sun Ke
Li Zongren.
If the President is a litearati,
I don't mind if you become Vice President
But the President is already a soldier
The Vice President should not be another soldier.
People will say this is a military government
Normally, I won't insist if you say so.
But since the election,
more than my effort is at stake.
Not that I don't want to step down,
I simply can't.
Without support from the Party,
you won't be elected.
Why be a laughing stock?
Let the numbers speak for themselves.
Maybe I'll win.
Definitely not.
Sun Ke 1, 295 votes.
Li Zongren 1, 438 votes.
According to the constitution of the ROC and electoral law,
I hereby announce, Mr. Li Zongren
is elected Vice President of the ROC.
I
do solemnly swear...
I haven't been to Beiping in years.
Commander-in-Chief of North China.
5 provinces and a few hundred thousand people under your command.
You're the king
Don't make fun of me.
Mr. Chiang has high regard for you.
If the new CPPCC
can invite half the people on this list,
we're half way there.
You're right.
You better write to General Feng personally.
I'll do that right now.
Mr Chairman, time to eat
Please join me, Enlai.
No, I must get back to Xibaipo.
Finish eating first
Very well.
Mr. Chairman,
the cook is Xiao Yan's old lad
He wants to see you
Of course
Thank you, sir.
Hurry.
His name is Guo Bencai. He's from my hometown.
Hello, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Kwok, you're a good cook.
It's worth everything to cook for you
Have a smoke
Thank you, sir.
Why...
It's your cigarette, I want to keep it.
Take this.
I can't.
Take it.
Thanks
Sir, this is Liu Congwen, the mess officer in the military zone.
Hello, sir.
Hello.
Hello, Mr. Zhou.
Hello. Mr Kwok.
Hello.
Mr. Chairman, any special requests for your meals?
We'II do the best we can.
I don't need much.
Make sure we put in chili.
I prepared for you already.
It'd be perfect
if I can have stewed meat twice a month.
Big fish in Chengnanzhuang
In a bungalow between 2 apricot trees near the mountains in the northern part of the village
Per your request,
field operation units
in Nanjing, Shanghai and Hong Kong have been removed.
Zhang Lan is stuck in Shanghai. Keep him under tabs.
Yes, sir
Li Jishen is in Hong Kong
He's not on our turf. Just keep an eye on him.
Yes, sir
As for Feng Yuxiang,
he's getting tight with the CPC.
He may defect
If necessary,
I'll tidy things up a bit
These are prestigious men
If you're sloppy,
public opinion overseas will backfire on us
I understand
Mao's location is confirmed?
Chengnanzhuang in Baoding.
He won't get away this time.
Remember, this is extremely important.
Confirm target, roger
Lao Guo, where are you going? This way.
Back to the kitchen. Chairman Mao's food is on the stove
Chairman?
He took some sleeping pills and went to sleep.
Wake him up. Enemy planes will be here soon.
Tiger, get a stretcher.
Yes
Wake up, sir. Enemy planes are coming.
They haven't dropped a bomb.
Then it'll be too late.
Let's go, sir
Calm down.
Cigarette.
Do that later.
Commander Nie.
Move Mr. Chairman to the bomb shelter on the stretcher
Yes, sir
Even if they start bombing,
that doesn't mean they'll hit me
I'm responsible for the Party
I'm very lucky.
Hurry.
Hurry.
Hurry.
Hurry.
Hurry.
Hello...
Well?
Still can't get through.
Keep trying.
Yes, sir
Telegram, sir.
Massive bombings, casualties unknown.
The food was still on the stove
when the bombing started.
Lao Guo said you have not eaten breakfast
He ran back to the kitchen
Telegram, Mr. Zhou
Mr. Chairman,
we have very positive response for the May 1 slogan.
The Parties have all signed their names.
Already?
What a surprise.
The situation is becoming clear
The CDL and the Revolutionary Committee are on our side.
Chiang is now completely isolated.
Everything will fall into place
It's time to call for a new CPPCC.
Jishen, Mao wrote you personally.
What's your concern?
Back in Fujian, we agreed to oppose Chiang.
But they changed their minds
Fujian was a few years ago.
That was Bo Gu, not Mao.
I'm not holding a grudge.
I don't need another fall
Chiang toyed with us for decades
No doubt the CPC has better credibility,
but what if...
We just set up a new Party.
As the Chairman of Revolutionary Committee of the KMT,
I must do my best
for the future of the Party
Issue a separate declaration
to oppose Chiang
Reiterate our opposition against one-party autocracy.
That'll be our response to the CPC.
Nowhere inside the Shanhai Pass
is a suitable venue for the new consultative meeting,
except Harbin
It's far away,
but at least it's a big city.
Feng Yuxiang will be home this month
He'll go directly to the Northeast.
Then let's settle for Harbin.
To build a new government for the whole country
without a decent big city,
it's just not adequate
Goods are scarce. Commodities entered the black market.
Everyone is buying
and selling short
The top brass in the military and political circles
are behind these activities.
Those profiteers
defy government orders.
Mr. Weng can't hold the fort much longer.
What's your solution?
I don't want your complaints.
I want a solution.
As the financial center in the Far East,
Shanghai is the key.
If we can stabilize the market in Shanghai,
the rest of the country will fall in line.
I must go to Shanghai.
Master Chiang, on behalf of Shanghai,
we're hosting a banquet for you at the Jinjiang Hotel.
I'll pick you up later
Tell everyone on the Special Commando Unit
to meet in my office in half an hour,
including you
In preparing for the new CPPCC,
the CPC is open for suggestions.
They don't intend to run the whole show.
They do things differently from the Nanjing government
What about Zhang Lan?
He's always for building the state via CPPCC
They already have a well thought-out plan
to escort you and my mother up north.
Mao invited you and Li Jishen up north
to discuss re-opening the CPPCC.
When is Li Jishen leaving?
Don't know yet
What's your answer?
I have decided
to stay put
But...
Let Shen Junru liaise with the CPC on behalf of the CDL
When are you leaving?
I'm too old and sick.
Besides, Chiang won't let me go that easily.
How can you not show for something this important?
I'm putting Shen Junru in charge.
I am Chinese.
Is that right, Father?
One stroke is missing.
Isn't this pretty, Uncle Mao?
Yes, but you can't eat everything.
Mr. Chairman, it's time for the meeting.
Let's go back
Will you carry me, Uncle Mao?
Carry me, Father.
Will you carry me, Uncle Mao? Father
Liya, do you want me to carry you?
Yes.
Let's go.
Any news, Enlai?
Chiang's economic reform is a deadlock.
Chiang Ching-kuo personally flew to Shanghai.
But the Bund is entrenched with powerful factions.
It's a labyrinth within the KMT.
Chiang's son won't accomplish anything.
Liya, let's play piggyback.
Yes.
Let's go.
No one should doubt the Government's
determination to implement financial reforms.
In face of a national crisis,
anyone who compromises the nation's interest
is a traitor
and an enemy of the KMT
I urge the elite of the business sector
and prominent individuals of society to work with us
to restore financial order and stabilize prices
in the shortest time possible
and do your best to save our country.
Mr. Chiang
Will you be fair?
What about those offenders who have influence?
How will you handle them?
My mission in Shanghai
is to hunt tigers, not squat mosquitoes.
Mr. Chiang, can you tell us
your concrete course of action?
Tigers are easy to hunt
but I'm afraid icebergs
are hard to remove.
You are...
Du Yuesheng
Mr. Du, I'm all ears
My son Weiping has been arrested
If he broke the law, I have no complaints,
but someone else in Shanghai
is hoarding supplies
and peddling them to the black market for profits,
openly defying the law
If you choose to overlook this,
President Chiang will be very disappointed.
Please point me in the right direction, Mr. Du.
I will look into it.
Read it.
7 godowns along the Bund.
The godown on No. 36 Nanjing Road.
No 17 Avenue Joffre.
12 godowns in the South Market using the word "Jia"
Mr. Chiang,
this is the real tiger.
Who is it?
Yangtze Company owned by the Kung's.
Wire Wei Lihuang, urge him to pull back south.
With crack troops like these,
even if we lose the Northeast, we can get it back easily.
President, we wired him several times
urging him to go south,
but he ignored us.
Get my plane ready,
I'II fly out to Shenyang
Yes.
The President
What is it?
Feng Yuxiang is dead.
Chairman.
What happened to you?
You bragged about your abilities.
You bragged about Shanghai.
You bragged about the Red Army. And now?
General Feng was burned to death.
You.
This is all you can do
Think it over. You won't get away.
You'll be executed if you lose a battle.
Now something went wrong on your front.
Tell me what you should do. Speak up.
KMT secret agents did it?
According to the Russians,
General Feng was watching a film in his cabin.
The film caught on fire and ignited the cabin.
The film caught on fire? He's a general.
Why didn't he run?
What a bunch of morons.
A man is dead, the Russians need to blame someone.
The ship was out at sea and abroad.
We didn't get all the facts
General Feng became a soldier at 12.
50 years in the battlefield didn't kill him
But our invitation
to send him abroad buried him at sea
I feel so guilty
General Feng may be dead
but he left behind a legacy
to build a new, independent China.
Enlai, wire our condolences to Madame Feng
and invite her to the CPPCC.
Yes.
Mr. Chairman, it has been suggested
that the CPPCC should act for the NPC
to elect the central government
A general election is hard to come by during the war
We must consult all the other Parties on this
Let's not waste any time.
Form the coalition government first, then call the NPC,
is that it?
Precisely
They're still in a war
They can't elect their delegates
We should make allowances for that.
I'll get in touch with Shen Junru
and pass on your message.
Mr. Mao and Mr. Zhou invited you up north again
Assemble.
Hurry.
Search all the godowns, buildings, apartments and villas
in Shanghai owned by Yangtze Company and the Kung's.
Operation starts at 7 am tomorrow morning, understand?
Mr. Chairman.
Voices within the US government have indicated
they will support your replacement of Mr. Chiang.
What do you think?
Whether they support me or Chiang,
it's a cheap trick to pit Chinese against Chinese
If the US wishes to maintain diplomatic relations with the future China,
ignoring the CPC
is unrealistic.
The second question.
If Vice President Li replaced President Chiang,
will things get better?
In terms of warfare,
Bai Chongxi is quite capable.
In terms of politics,
Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi together are no match for Chiang.
You did not answer my question, sir.
Here
What are you looking at?
Jinzhou.
That's over 1,000 km away.
More definite news won't arrive until tomorrow.
It's already 10:30 and yet no sign of attack. Which division was it?
The 8th column.
You asked me 5 times already
Really?
The Battle of Jinzhou is not just over a city or a region
If we win, we can go on
If we lose, the situation gets complicated
With regards to the draft agenda of the CPPCC,
Zhang Lan and Shen Junru made minor changes
They know we're at war.
They're being very understanding.
Zhang Lan is sick.
We should postpone his trip up north
We must invite him.
But we'll let him decide
when to come.
We'll wait.
Aunt, he has full authority
to seize everything owned by the Yangtze Company
He put out word all over Shanghai looking for me
Now I finally see him.
That ought to save him some trouble.
Have you gone mad, David?
Relax. He's the Liaison Administrator, the prince.
I wouldn't dare shoot the prince.
This is very simple, cousin.
Shoot me and it's all over
With the culprit dead, you'll be famous in Shanghai.
We'll both get what we want.
Ching-kuo.
It's clearly written in the state papers.
You're needed for questioning within 10 days
or you'll be severely punished.
7 days have gone by, you decide what to do next
Yangtze Company is our family estate.
I dare you to arrest my father.
Nonsense. It's clearly your fault
Leave your father out of this
If he and Ai-ling found out about your monkey business,
they won't spare you
This is how we do business in Shanghai.
But the arrival of a Liaison Administrator changed all that
Auntie, everyone does it. That's the rule
Only a feudalistic dictator
would run a business without rules.
Who are you calling a dictator?
The government is fighting a war and soldiers are dying on the front
But the state treasury is empty and we had to borrow from the Americans.
Currency has depreciated and prices have skyrocketed.
People are running scared.
But inside your godowns,
you hoarded over 100 thousand tons of supplies
which you are unwilling to sell.
I'm a businessman, not a philanthropist
The CPC is working on land reforms and political consultation.
Even Cai Tingkai and Shen Junru have left for the Northeast.
Mao is setting up his own government.
Madame, you've always supported Father.
I bet you never expected
right here in Shanghai,
someone is undermining him,
destroying the foundation of this country.
Their fortune, apartments,
clothes, perfumes and iceboxes are like a virus
residing on the mere skeleton of this country.
They are the enemy, Father's and the state's
That's enough,
Ching-kuo.
There are no enemies here, only family.
Let's talk about family today.
I'm not in the position to say anything
He Yingqin is the Director of National Defense
Take pains to stay save. Let Chiang talk to him.
You're a better marksman than He Yingqin.
So what?
Chiang owns China now.
Even this gun has his name engraved on it
What can we do about it?
The CPC troops use this type of rifle too.
What matters is not the name on the rifle,
but the man who uses it
Holding a rifle
beats holding an empty title of Director of National Defense
If you're the President,
will the Americans back us up?
Stuart dropped a hint.
Then let's get rid of Chiang.
It's still too early to say.
Never too early to take precautions.
It's time we get started
Ching-kuo, Madam is leaving for the US tomorrow
to ask President Truman for help.
The situation in the Northeast is deteriorating quickly.
We need help from the Americans
I flew back from the Northeast
just to tell you,
at a time like this
we can't afford a fire in the backyard.
Father
If we don't punish the Kung's,
the economy in Shanghai is doomed.
I absolutely understand
The corruption of the KMT is in the bones.
It's not just the problem of the Kung's
Crackdown on corruption is a major issue
Timing and extent are crucial...
it's tough.
You lose the Party if you proceed.
You lose the country if you don't.
It's tough.
Father
Both the Party and the country are on the brink of disaster.
Alright
The matter at hand
is to move the troops up North to south of the Yangtze River
to ensure the safety there
Going after the Kung's
is meaningless now.
Zhang Lan is truly a saint of Sichuan.
He deserves it.
Without him at the CPPCC,
none of us Sichuanese
would dare to go.
The Northeast is too cold for a man his age.
He probably can't make it
If anything happens to him...
What about Beiping?
What?
Postpone the meeting till next year.
Move the venue to Beiping
It's possible.
The troops are tired after taking Shenyang.
Fu Zuoyi commands 600,000 men.
Relying on 2 divisions in the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region
to capture Beiping is impossible.
According to our intelligence
lately, Fu Zuoyi is having second thoughts.
After the failed attempt on Shijiazhuang,
he seems willing to negotiate
Send someone reliable to liaise with him.
Ok.
It'd be heavenly, if we can liberate Beiping peacefully.
Fu's daughter Dongju is a Party member.
She's perfect for the job
Yes.
In that case, I'll be the dictator for a change.
Ask the Northeast Field Army to enter the Shanhai Pass within 7 days.
Tell Lin Biao
this is an order and not a probe.
It'll take a few days to gather up the troops
and each column needs time to adjust otherwise.
Moving inside the Pass will be a problem.
The cadres don't want to make the move
and it'll take time for deployment.
The deadline on the 22nd is too tight.
Wire this back: Received order dispatched on 18th at 18:00
Will set out on the 22nd as instructed.
Details to follow Signed, Lin, Luo & Liu
You should think for yourself too.
You really want me
to hold the horsewhip for your Chairman?
Forget it, Father It was a joke.
A joke?
I personally told the American reporter.
It's not a joke.
That's because you took it to heart
Li Jishen is a founding member of the Party who opposes Chiang openly
Over these last few months,
Mao has repeatedly invited him up north.
He's been stalling him. He's bewildered by
You come to see me
with a 18-year old newspaper.
How kind of you.
The quarrel between you and the President
should stay within the Party.
Between you and the CPC,
don't forget you ordered the execution of Cai Hesen.
What are you saying?
Return to Nanjing and pick any job you want,
as long as you don't join the CPC
A promotion for a promise?
You think I'll go?
Before I came, Vice President Li told me
he would like to liaise with the CPC through you.
Any condition is negotiable,
including using the Yangtze as a partition.
Use the Yangtze as a partition
and split up China?
Tell Li Zongren
The infamy is more than he can handle.
Hello, Mr President
Commander Fu.
Our troops can pull back to Tanggu and Zhangjiakou
I can't guarantee we'll win
But we're perfectly capable of defense.
With the big picture in mind.
I intend to move 600,000 men to Jiangnan
I can be more flexible in both defense and offense
That's containing our sovereignty to the southeast.
As the old capital, Beiping has political significance.
Giving it up
is unfavorable to our government internationally
You're right. International scope is the situation.
Wait.
What is it, Father?
Who's your commanding officer?
We agreed not to discuss that
I wish to talk to them.
About what? The horsewhip?
What I'm telling you now
will determine the lives of millions.
I understand
She's so hot.
I'm sorry, May-ling.
Both the House and the Congress
have refused your request to make another speech.
But the Government will still support the General as before
with the hope that the civil war does not continue any longer in China.
President Truman and his administration is concentrating on Europe.
But the East needs a revival too.
My friend.
China should have been included in your plan.
Any loans and assistance from the US now
should be spent on security and constructive activities,
not war
You got 400 million dollars from the original loan.
That's still in existence.
We both know there's only a few million dollars left.
And it's not enough to support my husband's administration
and his life's work.
Mr. Secretary of State,
we need your additional assistance,
please.
Madam, there's nothing more we can do.
New Year is coming up.
Make this announcement at month end.
About what?
If they want me to resign, I'll resign.
You can't do that, Mr. President.
It's not my choice.
But someone within our Party wants me out.
You repeatedly rejected Mao and Zhou's invitation.
You're too arrogant.
That's an overstatement, Madame Liao.
I'm tied up at home
And I'm also busy with military affairs
Preparations for the new CPPCC are moving along and days are counting.
After decades, the KMT can't be absent
You're still hesitant about going.
You expect Mao to fly to Nanjing to invite Chiang?
We're definitely not inviting him.
He's a war criminal, a murderer.
We can't have a CPPCC without the KMT.
Jishen, Chairman Mao said
he'd wait for you in Beiping.
Chief, some landlord's compound up ahead
The wall is too high for us to climb over.
Grenades won't blow it apart. Please send for the artillery.
Flare
Flare
Commander...
we have reached Beiping city
2 pieces of good news, sir
First,
Li Jishen, Shen Yanbing and Zhang Naiqi
left 4 days ago.
They boarded the Aldan and will disembark at Dalian day after tomorrow.
And the other one?
Chiang Kai-shek resigned
Mr. Ambassador.
As China's ally,
why is the US doing nothing at a time like this?
God help those who help themselves, my friend
I think Chiang is giving Li Zongren a hard time.
He knows Li wants to negotiate, so he brought it up first.
He doesn't want Li to get the credit
and he wants to give us a hard time.
He already stepped down, but he had to pull a stunt like this.
After this,
it would be tough for Li to talk to us.
The CDL and the other Parties
have yet to make a stand, they're waiting to see.
In my opinion,
deep down
they want us to talk.
Li Zongren wants peace, we want peace,
the other Parties want peace.
We'll do the Acting President a favor
Great.
Let's give him a chance to talk,
but we decide how.
Victory bulletin...
War communique from Huaihai
According to the wire,
550,000 enemies were killed and Du Yuming was captured.
What about the New 5th and the 18th?
Gone.
The 5 major divisions were wiped out.
Chiang is finished for good.
There'll be no more fighting north of the Yangtze.
Cheers.
This is the last battle.
We stay united till tomorrow.
Internationale
will come true.
This is the last battle.
We stay united till tomorrow.
"Internationale" will come true.
Father, it's cold on the ground.
Sit down.
Ching-kuo.
You did a good job in Shanghai. I'm very pleased.
I made Chen Cheng Governor of Taiwan.
Do you know why?
Your route of retreat?
Yes, Du Yuming's men were wiped out.
I lost all the men who can fight.
We can't count on the 1 million men we captured in Jiangnan
They can barely hold their rifles
The Yangtze is lost.
You intend to evacuate to Taiwan?
You're coming too.
You think Li Zongren won't get anywhere
with the CPC over the peace negotiations?
If we can't defeat them at war,
we won't beat them at the conference table
Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi thought
the CPC will settle for using the Yangtze as a partition
They don't know Mao Zedong.
Mao will never agree to
separate governments on both sides of the Yangtze?
Would you accept if it were you?
That'd depend on the US and the USSR...
Don't make it so complicated. It doesn't matter what anyone thinks
China was split into north and south in the past
but not today.
Who would want to be blamed for it?
Definitely not me
Mr. Zhang Lan
Right now, in your opinion,
will the CPC accept the Government's plea for peace?
Impossible.
Why is that?
If Chiang never gives up his so-called constitution,
The CPC will not recognize it
and neither will the people.
You know Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai very well.
Are they local revolutionaries
or mere agents working for international communist intelligence bureau?
What kind of question is that?
I want to know your view.
My view is that the CPC catered for the people
which explains their achievements today.
Achievements?
Yes, achievements.
Dear Zuoyi
You and I have come a long way.
Given the circumstances, you took matters into your own hands.
There's nothing I can do about that, but I have one request.
I will send planes to Beiping tomorrow
to airlift officers of the 13th Army ranked Major or above
and essential weaponry
On account of our long standing friendship, please help me out.
Chiang Chung-cheng.
Beiping fell Fu Zuoyi surrendered.
The CPC is moving in on the Yangtze and Nanjing.
With regards to my plea for peace,
the CPC accepted it
but raised 8 very harsh conditions.
Madame, if you speak on behalf of the Government,
Mao and Zhou may trust me.
As you know, Mr. Acting President,
I washed my hands in politics since the onset of the civil war.
There are rumors in the newspapers about me coming out of retirement.
The Trust had to issue a denial.
Madame.
Dr. Sun founded the KMT.
You can't sit back and
watch it go to ruin.
Don't forget, you may be the Acting President,
but Chiang Kai-shek is still the Party Chairman.
Looks like the Acting President is having a hard time.
Chiang stepped down in name only
He still has control of everything.
Li Zongren does not have enough authority.
He's only a puppet
Nothing will come out of the negotiation.
No wonder you turned him down
I don't want to go to Beiping
because Dr. Sun died there. Too many memories.
Master Zhang, you're a veteran of the United League
and Zhu De's mentor
Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu have great respect for you.
The Acting President issued a declaration for peace negotiation
You're the most suitable person to mediate.
If the CPC brought up 8 conditions,
go ahead and talk to them.
If Mao wants to talk,
he wouldn't raise these harsh conditions.
There should be room to negotiate in a negotiation.
That's why the Acting President sent me to haggle with them
To mediate.
As you know, the Government clamped down on the CDL.
It is now an illegal organization
I'm now in the same party as the Communists.
Please don't be upset, sir.
Mr Chiang issued that order,
not the Acting President.
I side with the revolutionary.
I won't haggle for the enemy
Sir.
See them out
A partitioned rule? China is not Korea.
The Yangtze is not the 38th Parallel.
Wire the General Front Committee.
Their war plan has been approved
The central government advises to move the plan up to end of April
Go
Hurry Are you ok?
Don't push
Lin Biao is still so skinny.
Eating 1 million Nationalist soldiers
didn't even make him fat
Comrades
On behalf of the Secretariat of the Central Politburo, I hereby announce
the commencement of the second meeting
of the 7th CPC Central Committee.
What should we do about Zhang Lan?
He'd rather die than go to Taiwan.
He's trouble to us if he stays.
Give him what he wants
Sir.
Get rid of Zhang Lan.
He's a man of influence, sir
The more reason to get rid of him.
I see
Openly or privately?
How can you do this openly?
Like I said, don't let me see him alive.
And no body if he's dead.
Don't make a mess.
I understand
Go on.
Take care
Stop
Get out.
Are you Zhang Lan?
Who are you?
What do you want?
Deputy Chief Yan Jinwen of the Shanghai Inspectorate
On behalf of the CPC, I will get you out
Trust me.
Brother Yan.
Morning, you're on duty?
Security has been tightened lately
Where are you going?
On Inspectorate business.
Mixing pleasure with business. My father is in the car.
Go ahead, do what you have to
No need, run along
Bye.
Let them through
Where are you taking us?
Up north
Enlai, where's the Chairman?
Went to get smokes.
Not a shop is open in two blocks.
Chengjun, you're the county committee secretary.
This can't go on.
After entering the city, rumor has it
capitalists and businessmen are exploiters
and we should punish them.
They're so scared no one is open for business.
This is not a small matter.
Revolution is our forte
but not economics.
Can't even get smokes without the merchants,
let alone market prosperity.
We need the capitalists back.
At this stage, we can't eliminate them yet.
Production must be handled with care.
If anything goes wrong,
it'll be worse than losing a battle.
We must know our limits
We must learn from scratch.
The gist of political consultation
involves capitalists and democracy activists.
We invite them to help run the country,
not to eliminate them.
We must be very clear on this: If we destroy them
and we can't run production on our own,
factories will close down and worker will lose their jobs.
We'll be smashing our own rice bowls.
We barely got our hands on them, don't smash them.
Comrades, we ask two things of you.
Keep your backs straight and your voices up, understand?
Yes.
Chairman Mao
General Fu, you flatter me.
I promised to hold your horsewhip if I lose.
Today, I'll hold the door for you.
You did not lose The loser is in Nanjing.
Don't hold the door for me
Help me open the door for a new China.
Salute
Sir.
I'm with the 28th Army
I'm here with the Tashan troops
to join the dress parade.
On behalf of
soldiers of the Red Army, dead or alive,
I salute you, Chairman Mao.
Forward...
Forward...
Forward...
Long live Chairman Mao
Are these the 100,000 used guns
you mentioned in Chongqing three years ago?
The CPC has come a long way
Long live Chairman Mao
Long live Commander Zhu
Long live Chairman Mao
Long live Commander Zhu
Long live Chairman Mao
Since they're crossing the Yangtze River anyway,
what the hell is the point of negotiation?
To surrender before the fight begins? I'm a soldier, I won't do it.
The CPC knew you're different from Chiang.
Mao knows you enjoy being in the army.
He personally told me you might continue to command the troops
up to as many as 400,000
Nonsense. I'm already the Minister of National Defense.
Zongren, we don't get along with Chiang.
That's our internal business.
It's not up to the Communists to jack us around.
What's the use of saying that now?
What are you suggesting then?
Let's wait for word from Xikou.
300,000 courageous PLA
crossed the Yangtze River on the 21 st.
The campaign started at midnight on the 20th.
Didn't even hold the defense line for one day.
He Yingqin is retreating.
They say to Guangzhou.
Shall we go with them?
I have to look after the interests of the United States
I should stay here in Nanjing.
I heard the Soviet embassy
had relocated to Guangzhou with the Government.
Morning, Madam. Morning
The sound of gunfire went on all night. It finally stopped.
Madam, you didn't sleep well.
I'll go for a walk.
Have you decided to leave?
Really?
Hello, Chairman Mao.
Hello, Chairman Mao.
Hello Jishen.
Mr. Zhou. This way, please.
Chairman, Zhang Lan is here.
Mr. Mao, you flatter me
Not at all.
Master Zhang, how are you? Mr Zhou
Welcome, please come this way.
Hello, Master Zhang.
Calling the CPPCC to establish a new people's Government,
I recommend you both for Vice Presidents.
I'd like to hear your opinion.
I'll go along with your arrangement.
You have something to say?
Is this your idea?
The Central Committee's idea
I killed members of your party.
That was then, this is now.
All roads lead to Rome.
We can't change history.
Nobody's perfect.
A personal matter, no matter how important, is a minor issue.
A state matter, no matter how trivial, is a major issue, For the new state,
be our Vice President on behalf of the Revolutionary Committee.
This is a state matter
Forget the past.
The CPC is willing to work with you to lead this country.
Let's help each other, as we're in the same boat now
Together, we'll make history.
As you wish.
I'll do my best for China.
We strongly urge our comrades in China
to set up their own government soon
The USSR will, at the earliest time possible,
set up diplomatic relations with the new regime.
That's wonderful.
The frantic bombing of Shanghai by the KMT is causing chaos.
I'm worried about Madam Sun's safety.
She's our most faithful friend when we were in dire straits
The new CPPCC is about to commence.
It won't be complete without her.
Men like us
won't know how to talk to her.
Send a female comrade to escort her here.
Enlai, we'II burden Yingchao with the task
Good idea.
Madam Zhou to escort Madam Sun.
I'll tell her right away.
To form a coalition government without you
is something the Party will never agree to.
Neither would the rest of the country
I'm only the vanguard
If I failed to convince you, Enlai would be next
and then Chairman Mao himself.
If we all failed to convince you,
we'd put this on the agenda of the CPPCC,
vote on it and send a delegation.
You Communists
won't stop until you get what you want.
What do you think of this house?
Not bad, spacious and bright.
Mayor Chen Yi said he'd giving it to you
as a permanent site for the youth center
of your China Welfare Fund.
The children can play in here every day.
That's wonderful.
Madam Sun
Times have changed, Zedong. You mustn't do that.
Only for Madam Sun.
Thanks for the invitation and Yingchao's company.
Now the Party can work with all delegates
to build a new state,
I must thank your help and support.
You have been a great help to the country and its people
and a benefactor of our Party.
Fellow delegates,
the yellow flag pole in the center of figure No 1 represents the Yellow River.
It stands out. Those in favor, please raise your hands.
Good. It's unilateral.
I object.
From an artistic perspective,
No. 32 is much better.
Mr. Tian is an artist
who's partial to the 5 stars.
The person who submitted this design
is an ordinary clerk from Shanghai
It was disqualified in the first round, but I want to bring it up again.
Because this design
is full of emotions.
I object to the version of the 4 stars representing the 4 classes.
I prefer the Yellow River pattern.
Simple and sharp.
How many in favor of the 5-star flag?
Delegate Xu Beihong suggests
we use "March of the Volunteers" as the national anthem
Let's hear your comments
The melody is good, but we need to change the lyrics.
This is a new China.
The original lyrics are outdated.
Mr. Tian Han, you're the lyricist.
What's your opinion?
I should refrain from commenting. I'll listen to the others.
I agree we should change the lyrics
We can't sing it every day,
especially this line:
its greatest peril."
It won't work
I disagree, "La Marseillaise" of France
is tragic but has been handed down till now
That's France, not China
The lyrics of the song remind us
not to forget the past. I agree
New China needs a new song for its new outlook.
Why use a song from an old movie?
What about you, Mr. Li?
was written for the war
I sang it before. It's inspirational and gets my blood boiling.
become our new Great Wall".
We must remember history.
No need to change the lyrics.
Well said.
Agree. I have a good sense for danger too
The Chairman wishes to keep the original lyrics.
What about you? You kept raising your hand.
They took the words out of my mouth I have no comment.
Let me say just one thing.
To be vigilant in peace time is what a mature nation should do
We'll let Mr. Tian Han decide
Then let's keep the lyrics.
Chairman Mao, fellow delegates.
Are you ready?
Look over here, ready.
This is a women's delegation.
Chairman, everyone is talking about the pattern on the national flag.
What do you think?
I like the Yellow River.
I disagree.
Can you fix the negative? Yes.
Take out the person next to me.
There are over 10 people next to you.
I mean the man who jammed in
Alright. Thank you
What's your reason?
Chairman, adding a pole to the middle
gives the impression of splitting up the country.
Is that the right interpretation?
Can't be that serious. Most people prefer this one
Gong Peng, what do you think?
We like No 32
Placing five stars in the left corner
with four small stars surrounding
and their tips pointing at the big star It looks pretty.
Chairman, the big star in the middle represents the Party
while the small ones represent the 4 classes
The symbolism is correct.
Looking at this flag makes one feel enthusiastic.
Enthusiastic?
I feel excited when I look at the flag.
Madam Sun likes this design too.
You have been abroad, your opinion should count
Please tell us what you think.
The five stars design is a good representation of China's situation.
Under the leadership of the CPC,
all the classes are united to build a new China
The color is sharp, solemn and grand.
The truth is, China is united. Well said.
We're united now and we'll always be in the future.
Is the air raid on Beiping feasible?
The Chairman wants feedback from the Air Force.
The flying radius is too big.
The planes must re-tank somewhere
or they won't make it back.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has liaised with the Americans in Korea
You can rest assured.
But the CPC has its air force now.
The Chairman only wants to know
if the air raid is feasible. That's all.
Despite the difficulties, as long as he issues the order,
we'll get it done.
Fellow delegates,
the CPPCC that the whole country is looking forward to
will now commence.
The new CPPCC
will commence on a brand new foundation
It represents the Chinese people
and has the people's faith and support
Therefore, the CPPCC hereby announces
its right to call this meeting
Fellow delegates,
we have a consensus
that our work here
will go down in history.
It proves that China, which accounts for 1/4 of the world's population,
is finally on her feet
The destiny of China is in the hands of her people
China will rise like the sun in the east.
Its radiance will illuminate the land
and cleanse the filth and mire left behind by the reactionary government.
Heal the wounds of war and build a brand new
and powerful People's Republic of China.
Long live the People's Republic of China.
Long live the Coalition Government.
Long live the unity of the people
According to Commander Zhou,
the planes are in Class A status.
They're ready to bombard Beiping any time.
But the US has turned down our request to refuel in Pusan.
What does that mean?
They can't come back after takeoff.
What time is Mao's founding ceremony?
3pm at Tiananmen Square.
It's fate. The KMT is ruined with our own hands
Cancel the mission
Yes, sir
The People's Republic of China and
the Central People's Government
have been established today

For thousands of years China was a first class world power.
Why has China declined
to such a degree?
Because we, the Chinese people, have been asleep.
Down with the military government!
No disarming! No surrender!
Protect the Shanghai worker's movement!
Down with the warlords!
Down with the military government!
No disarming! No surrender!
Protect the Shanghai worker's movement!
Down with the warlords!
Down with the military government!
No disarming! No surrender!
Protect the Shanghai worker's movement!
Down with the warlords!
Down with the military government!
No disarming! No surrender!
Move! This is a peaceful demonstration!
What are you doing?
Why would you shoot at us?
This is a peaceful demonstration!
Ready,
fire!
Director Zhou!
Si Li!
Am I, Zhou Enlai, being the target?
No way.
The situation is not safe.
My brother said your safety must be guaranteed.
This way.
Where is Mr. Du?
He has been waiting a long time for you inside.
I'm three minutes early.
The worker's militia was sent by the trade association.
Today the workers have guns.
Tomorrow the peasants will want guns too.
What good is the army?
The worker's uprising
overthrew the Beiyang government in Shanghai
and should be credited for the revolution!
I am a soldier
and it is my duty to obey commands.
Was the command from Wang Jingwei?
No.
Then from whom?
I will say it one more time.
Apologize to us
and return the worker's militia's guns.
These are our two basic conditions.
This speech,
I'm afraid, shouldn't come from me.
Then who on earth should it come from?
Some things must be stated clearly!
You can't become president of the Shangai Labor Union anymore.
Come and work for me
and I'll give you a few bars of gold every month
to feed your family.
You should know well
what kind of man I am.
I do. I do know.
You got rid of the Beiyang government
in Shanghai with just a few battered rifles.
Your whole life is ahead of you and your potential is limitless.
Please wait.
This is what you get for harboring the worker's militia!
Wang Shouhua,
I have the utmost respect for you.
So please, you must take this cup of wine.
First, a toast to your good self.
Second, a toast to your faith.
Third, a toast to your perseverance.
Chop them up!
You commie! Write something now!
I asked you to write something!
I, Zhou Enlai, am never leery of my friends.
Si Lie...
You can stop now; it's not too late.
I have no authority or influence here.
Back when you sent your brother to the Huangpu Military Academy,
we recited Dr. Sun Yat-sen's admonition together.
Do you remember?
The Three Principles of the People.
"Our aim shall be:
To found a free land,
World peace, be our stand.
Lead on, comrades,
Vanguards ye are.
Hold fast your aim,
By sun and star."
You wept then.
But less than 3 years later
you've turned your back on your beliefs.
Toppling the foreign powers in China,
uniting the entire country,
and rebuilding the republic.
These are the lifelong ideals of Dr. Sun.
But you've turned your gun on your brother
before the Northern Expedition has even finished.
That was not my intention at all.
I've told you. I am a soldier
and I follow orders.
Orders from whom?
The Nationalist Government in Wuhan,
the Beiyang Government in Beiping
or the Nanjing Military Government Chiang Kai-shek wants to found?
Three governments in one country
and you say the country's not splitting?
You still say it's not a betrayal to Dr. Sun?
Chairman Wang Jingwei and General Secretary Chen Duxiu
issued a joint statement calling for strength, unity, and cooperation.
Si Lie,
you're being used as cannon fodder by careerists!
When the circumstances change,
have you thought about how things will end for you?
Please enlighten me, Mr. Zhou.
I have served with Commander-in-Chief Chiang for several years.
I know a thing or two about him.
When Wuhan began to bring those responsible to account,
would he have helped you escape?
Mr. Zhou,
there was no way around
offending you today.
When I see you again,
I will offer you my sincerest apology.
Dismissed!
Thank you for your advice.
Sir.
"Take down the military dictatorship.
"Chiang Kai-shek Orders to Dismiss the Political Departments in the Armies.
"Revolution has yet to succeed; Comrades must still exert themselves."
Commander-in-Chief, express telegram from Beijing.
Read it
Zhang Zuolin arrested Li Dazhao in the Russian Embassy
and he's asking what should be done about him.
Well, he certainly knows how to shift responsibility
by asking my opinion.
What did he say?
"Li Dazhao
is the leader of the Northern Branch of KMT.
He lives in the capital in secret
and colludes with foreigners.
He's now caught in the act.
What should be done with him?"
Send Zhang a telegram and say
the Party is being purged
and the suspect is no longer a member of the Nationalist Party.
As his case relates to foreign affairs,
it's recommended he be tried soon
and then executed
to avoid further ado.
If we keep this up,
the revolution will be wiped out
and the Communist Party will be destroyed.
We have to show our cards
and voice the most rigorous protest.
I ought to write articles
and expose the true colors of that bastard Chiang Kai-shek.
Soldier boy...
New here?
You look like a baby.
I'm clearly older than you.
I was born in the Year of the Goat.
So was I.
Which month?
December.
I'm August.
Call me big brother.
Like hell I will.
What are you talking about?
This would be suicidal.
Wang Jingwei doesn't know what to do.
Wuhan
has a storm on the horizon.
Let us hear Comrade Chen Duxiu's opinion.
The forces amassed by the workers and peasants over the years
were slaughtered by more than half on a single day.
As the Party's general secretary, I feel the most pain.
The Communist Party and the Nationalist Party had an agreement
to form a united front
in the revolution together.
But Chiang Kai-shek
now uses the weapons supplied by the Comintern
to slaughter us.
We have to arm ourselves
and fight this aggression.
Indeed we must fight.
Our blood must not be shed in vain.
Confronting the enemy head on
puts us at a disadvantage.
But giving them free reign
is out of the question.
We have only one option:
Hand over our weapons immediately.
Our weapons?
Why give them our weapons?
Be quiet!
Why give them our weapons?
Because we don't have a lot of guns to hand over in the first place.
Since we hardly have any guns already,
what's the harm in handing them all over?
Once we give them up
we become like sheep
that anyone could slaughter at will.
Wang Jingwei and his Wuhan government
are sympathetic to communists
and the revolution.
If all the armed workers and peasants
in this country
handed over all their weapons,
Chiang Kai-shek would have no excuse to harm us
and Wang Jingwei would try his best to help us.
China faces a crisis
and our hope should continue to rest in...
continue to rest in...
Wang Jingwei now wants to get in bed with Chiang Kai-shek
and this is their conspiracy!
We can't trust them!
What happened?
Comrade Li Dazhao
was murdered
by warlords.
Not a single rifle can be surrendered.
If we do, our fate as communists
will be the same as Li Dazhao!
Zedong, it's not the turn of the Hu'nan representatives to speak!
Can we rely on the Wang Jingwei government?
No, we can't!
And it would be suicide for us to hand over our guns!
We have only one way to go
and that is armed struggle!
We once criticized Sun Yat-sen for engaging exclusively in armed campaigns.
But what about us?
We reach for the pen and ignore the rifle.
And in the end we will only usher in a massacre.
Yes.
You are just being an alarmist!
Chen Duxiu, you and Mr. Li walked out in front of the revolution
and now you want to surrender our arms. Why?
I will do it to protect the working class
and grow the revolutionary forces.
This is just some contrived measure!
How many workers are there in China?
Very few.
Our country is mainly comprised of peasants.
Such a backwards class of people.
Once the land issues are solved
and the peasants are armed,
they become the capital for our revolution
as well as our largest force.
Do you understand any of this?
Right now I don't,
but I will in the future.
Get out!
How dare you distort Marxism?
Who do you think you are?
Zedong!
Mao, get out now!
Get out!
Comrade Wang Shouhua,
today is the 49th day since you
and your 300 comrades died on April 12.
I hereby pledge
that for the realization of our glorious common ideal
to found a new China,
I, Zhou Enlai, will fight for the rest of my life
and stay devoted
till my heart ceases to beat.
You were elected a member of the Political Bureau at the 5th CPC National Congress.
The Congress decided to
suspend the Military Department
and organize the Central Military Commission
with you as the general secretary.
Mao Zedong made a good point.
What did he say?
He spoke the truth.
He was in charge of mobilizing peasants in Guangzhou
and I didn't know
he had such a unique opinion on armed struggles.
He wrote "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement In Hunan"
and has a deep understanding of China's situation.
We also need to maintain our path of urban struggles.
Fighting with two fists
is the only way to overwhelm the enemy.
Yingchao,
pack up.
We are going to Wuhan.
Wuhan?
You came to see me as soon as you reached Wuhan.
Do you have an emergency?
I read your speech
and really wanted to speak with you.
We should smokeless
and learn more.
Right now the Party needs to hear your voice.
I have already been driven out
and no one is willing to listen to me anymore.
But I am a communist and I'm willing to listen.
See, am I not here for you already?
Cigarettes are such a wonderful thing.
It would be terrible to not know how to smoke them.
But once you know how,
they make you feel like an immortal.
They are just like a weapon.
They bring hope in good hands
and disaster in bad.
April 12 was a bloody lesson.
Almost all the armed forces in Shanghai were lost
and I am responsible.
In Sichuan,
He'nan,
Hubei and Guangdong,
they are still purging the communists.
This is because our power is still being weakened.
We should have no more illusions.
If we still want to continue our revolution
we have to create an army with revolutionary faith.
But now is the low tide of the revolution.
Don't lose heart.
We have millions of troops.
Can't you see them?
From where?
Peasants.
China has four hundred million peasants.
For generations
they have been bullied by the landlords and the rich
and have suffered a great deal.
They are like dry kindling covering the ground.
All it takes is a spark
and there will be a devouring fire.
Few peasant uprisings have succeeded
throughout history.
You and your comrades who have studied overseas,
praise the example set by the French Revolution
and the method of urban riots.
The working class is the main body of the revolution.
This is the general view of Marx, right?
I think China is different.
We may lack the experience
but we don't lack the courage to try.
Starting from where?
From zero, of course.
Find people if we have no one, and buy guns if we have no guns.
I'll go persuade the army.
I'll mobilize the peasants.
Last year in the Zhongshan Incident,
we stood together.
Now we stand together once more.
If what we're experiencing now is a failure,
then we communists...
We will continue to rise again and again.
Too wet.
Feng Yuxiang...
Is he going to lobby for Chiang?
I'm worried they have made a secret agreement.
The trouble is not Feng
but the communists.
Are you concerned they may start a rebellion?
"Cable from the Comintern."
Look at this. This was just intercepted.
You are right.
Ye Jianying,
can you pinpoint the information's source?
Yes.
Wang Jingwei and his men intercepted a cable
from the Comintern giving permission to Communists to begin an armed struggle.
Chiang slaughters us
and Wang Jingwei wants to join.
Then let's fight!
We can't fight them head on. We must save our strength.
Those comrades whose identities have been exposed
must leave Wuhan immediately.
Ye Ting,
lead the 11th Army to leave the city
and head east to Jiujiang.
Yes, sir.
Actually,
there is still one person we can win over.
You mean Zhang Fakui?
He only sympathizes with us verbally,
but his heart lies on Wang Jingwei's side.
I was referring to the commander of the 20th Army,
He Long.
General,
you run into a problem?
Your eyes gave it away.
Yeah.
I ran into a few.
There are still two we are facing.
Who are they?
Ye Ting...
His troops have the nickname of
the "Iron Army."
I met him once.
He is a hero.
Miss,
the true hero
is right in front of you.
All right. All right.
Who is the other problem?
He Long...
Unlike us, he didn't graduate from Huangpu.
In western Hu'nan he has built an army with two kitchen knives.
He began his Northern Expedition alone
and handed the Beiyang army a string of defeats.
Commander He,
in addition to this silver
and the post of Wuhan Garrison Commander,
we also offer what any officer would want the most.
You can promise Ye Ting's post to He Long,
and let them battle it out like two animals in a cage.
Then He Long will offer to come work for you.
Two birds with one stone.
Good.
Thanks.
The chips Mr. Chiang has offered
are expensive indeed.
What I advocate the most
is a full arsenal.
Then, please make your decision, Commander He.
I am right here for you to arrest.
I, He Long, may be illiterate.
But regarding which friend is worth having
and which is a scoundrel,
I can tell the difference.
So are we communists.
Maybe not.
Multiple times I offered to join you
but you turned me away.
Who turned you away?
Zhang Guotao!
This man is extremely arrogant
and has labelled me a bandit.
Am I a bandit?
I'm a soldier!
He has a good point.
You are always yelling to fight and to kill.
Fight?
Would you sit back with your arms folded
while the poor are bullied?
If you turn a blind eye
when they are bullied, you are an accomplice.
You fight for others' justice
but you can save only a few at most.
We communists want to fight for everyone's justice
and change millions of our people's lives.
That's exactly right.
I would not embark on
that evil ship with Chiang.
As for the gifts,
I will take care of them.
It's a shame we don't have
the Hanyang Arsenal.
Otherwise we'd have all the guns
and cannons we could want.
We would kick those bastards' asses
so they would cry for their mothers.
Chiang and Wang have split with the communists
and the world now sees communists as a threat.
In such a critical moment, Commander He knows so clearly what is right.
You are the kind of friend I must have.
A friend like you
is also what I need.
Anything else?
The Mosin-Nagans...
I can't get those.
That's what the Red Russians gave the Cantonese.
We would lose our heads
if we smuggled those out.
Have you served in the army?
I served for a few days.
I want all these guns.
I don't accept Canton Bank notes.
You have to pay in silver dollars.
That's not enough.
Here, take this.
That can be enough.
As a token of our friendship.
Also deliver the goods to Manager Luo.
Manager Luo you say.
Do you mean Luo Ronghuan?
Correct.
Then I know what you're doing.
You can keep the money
as well as the guns.
You are doing something big.
I'm keeping this watch
as the bond between us.
You are a hero
and I admire you.
The Nationalist Government is willing to accommodate you with the utmost sincerity.
United we stand. Divided we fall.
The Nationalist Government reaffirms
that any force attempting to thwart the Northern Expedition revolution will be...
Both Chiang and Wang were students of Dr. Sun Yat-sen.
Nobody expected they would betray the revolution one after the other.
This has had a chilling effect.
We will not give up.
The communists will remember forever
our intentions to follow Dr. Sun's revolutionary path.
I hope you can maintain this youthful zeal forever.
China's future
depends on you.
Madam,
I am here to say goodbye to you.
Where are you going?
Jiangxi
and then Guangdong.
To rekindle the spark of the revolution,
we must organize our own troops.
If it's necessary,
feel free to use my name
so that more people will support you.
No,
support us.
Fakui,
the communists see me as the last Emperor Shizong of Later Zhou.
And you as Zhao Kuangyin, his trusted general who robbed him of the empire.
Chairman Wang is fond of a joke.
Military men don't talk about politics.
All the communist soldiers are under your command.
That Ye Ting...
When the conditions are right there will be a coup
and the Nationalist Government's Chairmanship
will be yours sooner or later.
Chairman Wang,
it's not appropriate for you to say so.
I am not that kind of man.
As for how faithful I am to the Nationalist's Government,
it is there for all to see.
Then send a telegram
calling Ye Ting onto Lushan Mountain and let us confront him.
If he truly dares to rebel,
I will drown him with my own hands.
We can call him to the mountain for a military conference.
Then, that commander from the 20th Army...
He Long is not a communist.
Forget about it if there are real difficulties.
Don't underestimate the skill of sewing.
Sometimes
it's more important than firing a gun.
All finished.
Let me see.
Who taught you this?
Lady!
Lady! Who taught you this, Lady?
My morn did when I was little.
So you are a little girl!
A little skill never hurts anybody.
Haven't you heard of such a saying?
Watch me!
So you mean
this Lushan Conference is some kind of a trick?
Wang Jingwei wouldn't dare to seize your military power so openly
for fear it will cause a mutiny.
The Lushan Conference is just a ruse.
Once you leave your troops and go up the hill,
you'll become like teethless tigers
and you'll be bullied like sick cats.
Some kind of ambush.
I don't think it would be easy
to pull out my teeth, huh?
Here, try some.
Hey Boatsman,
nice congee.
Comrade Ye Ting taught me well.
You're not too bad at flattery either.
He really taught me well.
Su Yu!
Yes, sir.
Come,
have some congee.
Thank you.
At this point we can't return to Wuhan,
and if we head east
we'll be forced to confront Chiang Kai-shek head-on.
It is not wise for our troops to stay in Jiujiang.
Now at this crucial moment
this Zhang Fakui has become the reactionaries' lackey.
What we do next will not be easy.
What are you talking about?
Oh I apologize.
We are accustomed to speaking Cantonese among ourselves.
We're talking about where the army will be going.
Where then?
To Nanchang.
The Central Committee has decided
to stage an uprising in Nanchang.
The enemy has only 6,000 troops in Nanchang
and our 11th Army and 20th Army
together command a total of 20,000 troops.
We hold an absolute advantage.
Nanchang
has Chiang Kai-shek to the east,
Wang Jingwei to the west
and Zhang Fakui to the north.
All three are at war with one another
and none of them will send in troops
once we begin to act.
Besides,
in Nanchang City
we still have a Zhu De.
Zhu De?
Is he the guy who went to Berlin looking for the Communist Party?
I don't need to go that far.
I am right here looking for the Party.
After the uprising,
I will sponsor you to become a Party member.
Why don't I take this job?
You need a sponsor to join the Party?
This is a provision of the Party's Constitution.
All right.
Regardless of who my sponsor is,
I request
to be stationed on the frontlines.
Comrades,
Nanchang is only the beginning.
Our goal is to fight all the way back to Guangzhou,
assemble our forces,
and launch a new Northern Expedition
to unify China.
Commander Ye, Report.
I am the Colonel for the Nanchang City Garrison,
Chen Feng.
If I may enquire, sir.
Speak.
What, may I ask, is the purpose of your troops' coming to Nanchang City?
To head east to face Chiang Kai-shek.
Commander Ye, Report.
Our troops have not received any command.
This is the command.
As my job requires...
Attention!
Welcome the "Iron Army" of the Northern Expedition to enter the city!
Welcome the "Iron Army" of the Northern Expedition to enter the city!
Wang Jingwei's telegram to purge the communists
indicates he is on our side.
But some generals support him as China's leader.
We must be cautious.
He will not become someone significant.
The ones I really worry about are Ye Ting,
He Long
and Zhou Enlai.
Right now these three
can't bring too much chaos.
There are many competent men
surrounding Zhou Enlai.
You must be careful.
I understand.
By the way.
Have the gifts for Miss Mei-ling
been prepared?
They have all been sent to Shanghai.
Well, Miss Mei-ling
prefers plane trees
and wants Nanjing
to be full of them.
I have arranged people to implement your gorgeous plan.
Also,
the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Consortium
must be brought into the fold.
Our success relies 30% on military and 70% on the economy.
The country will be at peace
as long those old guys are fed well.
Yes, sir.
With this
we can change the colors of the whole world.
Luo Ronghuan,
don't you think so?
Enlai!
You treated me to wine in Berlin
and now I bring you a jar of liquor from your hometown.
How many people do you have under your control?
A few hundred, I guess.
During the uprising
I need you to eliminate one regiment.
Only one regiment?
We could take on an entire division easily.
I do have some conditions I would like to address.
Say it.
When I joined the Party
all of my money went to Party dues
and I need funds to finance this mission.
Tell me how you will use the money.
Don't worry about that.
You will know when the time comes.
Waiter! Four bowls of rice noodles.
Coming!
My... My legs are almost broken.
Here are your rice noodles.
Hurry up!
Coming!
Hurry up!
Enjoy.
Hey! Come here!
Do you need something, sir?
Where are my rice noodles?
Those military gentlemen was here first.
I'm cooking yours now. Doing it now.
Hold on.
This is even more delicious than the noodles in Guangzhou.
Well, I see this restaurant
feeds pigs first.
What did you say?
I didn't know pigs could understand human language.
I dare you to say that again!
I said you are pigs.
Who are pigs?
Zhao Fusheng pays his respects to his superior.
Who is the pig?
I am, sir.
A vice battalion commander
can be so hard on his comrades' troops.
If they were civilians
I bet you'd eat them alive, huh?
Sir, I wouldn't dare, sir.
I'm teaching you a lesson on behalf of Commander He.
If you were my soldier
I would parade you through the streets!
Lesson learned. Thank you, Commander.
Please take care on the road, Commander Ye!
Here are your rice noodles!
Chen Feng!
I have seen it all.
I apologize, I made a scene.
Well, I thought you guys were having a good time in Wuhan.
Why did you come to Nanchang?
I have no idea!
Now Commander He looks like he's possessed
and insisted on coming to Jiangxi with that Cantonese guy.
Now all the high posts in the army have been taken by the Cantonese
and we, the veterans who risked our lives,
are no longer popular.
That bearded He is just a western Hu'nan bandit
and is not like us.
Let me be frank with you.
He Long is singing Xipi with those scholars all day long.
Sing Xipi?
I don't know what it means either.
Even the Cooking Corps has asked about it.
CCP.
What is CCP then?
Chinese Communist Party.
Zhao Fusheng,
you must follow the right people in society these days.
How about this...
Will you follow me?
I can at least make you vice commander of a regiment.
Besides, we have
a special fund every month.
Our Jiangxi rice noodles are really good.
Try some.
I'll see you later, Chen Feng.
Everyone, there are 6,000 enemy troops garrisoned in Nanchang City.
They are set up mainly at the 5th Army Headquarters' rear office
in the Financial Commissioner's building.
The 23rd regiment of the KMT 3rd Army in the Examination Hall,
and the 24th regiment of KMT 3rd Army is at the New Camp Gate.
The enemy's main position occupies the area
from the main street to the Financial Commissioner's Building.
Commander He Long,
this is yours to take.
The artillery is ready to offer support at any time.
The gate tower,
with it's commanding height over Nanchang City,
is extremely important.
Ye Ting, your troops are charged with taking it.
Come on guys, all of you.
Come and take a picture!
We're about to start a fight
and it will be a tough one.
There are not many guards in the railway station
and it must be taken as soon as we begin,
in order to cut off their retreat.
Let me stress this last point:
He Long's men must take the Financial Commissioner's Building before dawn!
No problem!
Everyone wear a red scarve around your collar
and tie a white towel to your right arm.
A red cross should be placed
on everyone's flashlight lens
to avoid friendly fire
in combat at night.
You've thought of everything.
Regiment Commander, an invitation for you from Commander Zhu.
Chen Feng in Nanchang is a serious problem.
He was suspicious of us when we marched into the city.
If Chen wires to Lushan to see what's going on
all of us will be exposed.
As for me,
I agree with the uprising.
But...
the Comintern has given clear instructions to us
to win over Zhang Fakui.
So I hope you can comply with the wishes of the Central Committee.
So now we have everything ready
and suddenly there is an international influence stepping in
to obstruct the uprising.
I object!
I said, comply with the decision of the Central Committee.
Zhang Fakui will arrive in Nanchang on August 1st
and his goal is to come here and wear us down.
The uprising is like an arrow on the bow.
It cannot be stopped!
They keep shifting their commands.
This is Rightist Capitulation!
I think you are a Leftist radical!
To establish a new revolutionary team,
we must be willing to give everything up.
If we miss this chance, we'll regret it forever.
As the General Secretary of the Frontline Committee,
I can decide on all matters regarding the Nanchang uprising.
If you make such wild claims,
where does that leave
the Central Committee and the Comintern?
Tie him up!
Commander He!
This is a high-level internal meeting.
What are you doing here?
Facing a formidable enemy,
nobody has the right to demoralize the troops!
Nobody!
Enlai,
let me ask you this single question:
this uprising,
do we do it or not?
The uprising will not be delayed...
Zhou Enlai!
...unless I'm dismissed as General Secretary of the Frontline Committee on the spot.
You!
I don't think things are that complicated.
I have a solution.
Okay, let's hear it.
Take you out.
I'll take care of it.
What are you doing?
I didn't think
that communists would kill one of their own.
Sorry,
I'm not a communist yet.
Now the whole country is in white terror.
If something
happens to Comrade Zhang Guotao,
we won't receive any command.
Any problem for the uprising?
Well,
if... I mean if...
According to the Party Constitution,
everyone votes on it.
I have never been to Nanchang.
More than half. It meets the quorum.
The Nanchang Uprising is scheduled for 4a.m.
on August 1.
Marker: three gunshots.
Code word:
"Unifying the Country."
I'm back.
Zhao Fusheng, change your equipment.
Is there any action?
4a.m.
Dear friends,
cousins
and brothers!
Today we gather in Nanchang
and this place is honored
by your gracious presence!
Everyone, please enjoy your time
and get very, very drunk!
Hurrah!
Before we act,
I have a plan
to invite all the leaders
in Nanchang to drink
until they are
completely drunk.
This should buy you all some time.
This is the reason you asked for a fund?
Of course.
It costs money to rent a place,
buy alcohol
and find these people.
Nobody move!
Don't move!
I get first pick.
What are we waiting for? Let's take them.
Hey, Chen,
something on your mind?
Chief Zhu,
such a spectacle today...
I'm not used to it.
Basically every officer in Nanchang is here.
I'm concerned that if anything happens...
Excuse me.
Report!
Zhao Fusheng, one of our vice battalion commanders,
left and has not returned.
Zhao Fusheng!
That menace!
I've lectured him already.
Is it likely that he would leak the information?
Better play safe
than be sorry.
I suggest
we hold an emergency meeting now
and adjust the uprising plan.
Check your markers.
Once the fighting starts
we identify the markers only, not the person.
Chen Feng!
Fusheng.
Something terrible is happening!
Hurry up!
Everybody, assemble!
Everyone, assume your position
and prepare to fight!
Everyone,
assume your position
and prepare to fight!
Understand?
Yes, sir!
How are the preparations coming?
Two regiments of the 24th Division are ready
and every member is on standby.
The artillery outside the city is ready for battle.
The 20th Army is ready for battle.
I don't know what's happening with Zhu De's troops.
Don't worry.
He doesn't make mistakes.
Brothers!
Take the Financial Commissioner's Building
within the hour!
Yes, sir!
Move out!
Fire!
Fire!
Report!
Our 20th Army's Training Regiment
has seized the new barracks of the 3rd Army's 79th Regiment.
Don't move!
Don't move!
Nobody move!
Report!
The guard companies from the Training Regiment and 4th Regiment of the 24th Division
now occupy Niuhang Railway Station.
The Railway Station!
Nothing.
Why?
The phone line has been cut.
Report!
Our 72nd Regiment has captured
the 23rd Regiment of KMT's 3rd Army at the Examination Hall.
What's the situation?
Go on! It's nothing!
Go!
What are you doing?
Somebody help! Now! The machine-guns!
Retreat from the gate!
Report! The gate is being shelled!
He Long's troops have been discovered on the main street!
Attack!
Send the 6th Company to reinforce the city gate!
It must be held!
I want the Maxim machine-guns on the main street
where we make our final stand
against this He Long!
Save him!
Take a flour bag.
Provide cover fire!
Charge!
Follow!
Follow me to the gate!
Hurry up! Get everything!
Don't move! Nobody move!
Put down what's in your hands!
Put it down! Put everything down!
Don't move! Put your hands up!
Don't move! Drop it!
Don't move!
Take the hard cash first!
We're facing a revolution
and this money
is temporarily requisitioned.
It will be returned
when the war is over.
Understand?
We are writing you a receipt.
Quick!
Take it!
Go!
Go with several men, sneak out of the city
and ask for reinforcements!
Feng, one more thing.
Remember.
They wear red scarves on their collars
and white towels on their arms.
Don't move! Don't move!
Put the gun down!
Don't move! Identify yourself!
Don't move!
Don't shoot!
Password!
We're friends!
Remember, everyone has a red scarf on their collar
and a white towel tied to their right arm.
Why are you crying?
Go!
We met resistance at the gate. Requesting support!
How is the 20th Army doing on the main street?
It's a stalemate.
I'm going!
Let's move!
Commander! Commander!
He Long's troops are about to break through our defenses
and we can't hold much longer!
Outflank them!
Take cover!
Take cover!
Report!
He Long's troops have taken the clock tower
but face strong resistance at the Financial Commissioner's Building.
Fire!
Firing positions!
Retreat!
Report! We are unable take Deshengmen Gate
and our casualties are so heavy
that we are forced to retreat. Request reinforcements!
Stop crying!
Get me bandages now!
Give them to me now!
Stay with me!
Hold on!
Come help me, now!
Mortar!
Mortar!
Distance 370...
Fire!
Report!
Ye Ting commands reinforcement troops
to begin shelling Deshengmen Gate!
Get ready!
Don't stop! Drop everything you've got on them!
Fire!
Su Yu! Attack!
Get ready!
Go!
Retreat!
Grenade!
Get ready!
Fire!
Don't move!
Don't move!
Put the gun down!
Take them away!
Report!
The battle has ended!
Our troops have captured the Financial Commissioner's Building
and occupy Deshengmen Gate!
Don't move!
Stay down!
Don't move!
Take this!
Stay close to me!
Follow me!
Put down your gun!
Put the gun down!
Commander!
We have won!
Victory!
Brother, why are you so late?
The battle is over!
A Mosin-Nagant.
I saved this for you.
Don't be too cocky.
Later, I will return to you a new one.
Don't forget you said that.
Victory!
Soong Ching-ling, Tan Pingshan, Liu Yazi and Mao Zedong
have composed a Declaration of Members of the Central Committee.
What does it say?
One:
Oppose the directives and resolutions issued in the name
of the Central Party Bureau by a few members of the Central Committee in Wuhan.
Two:
Uphold the Three Principles of the People for building a society
of the people, by the people and for the people
and support the Three Great Policies of
allying with Russia and the Communist Party, and assisting the workers and peasants.
Three:
Work hard to build a new base area,
so as to convene the Third National Congress
outside the spheres of the old and new warlords, to discuss
the question of concentrating the revolutionary forces
and continuing the revolutionary work.
I really don't understand
why Mrs. Sun is involved with the communists.
Seven:
Actively prepare our forces
to wipe out new-style warlords like Chiang, Feng Yuxiang and Tang Shengzhi,
who represent the forces of all the imperialists,
the northern warlords, and feudal society within the country.
To wipe out Chiang, Feng Yuxiang and Tang Shengzhi.
I am the top of the list.
I guess this means
things between us are irreconcilable.
Commander-in-Chief,
Li Jishen wired us from Guangzhou to ask
what should be done about the rebellion in Nanchang.
Let them decide on their own.
Jishi,
south of the Yangtze receives little rain in late summer.
The newly planted plane trees in Nanjing
should be watered well.
Miss Mei-ling asked about this yesterday.
Yes, sir. I will keep that in mind.
Both Zhou Enlai and Mao Zedong are people with ideals.
They both have a desire
to transform China.
But this is in opposition to Chiang's interests.
I think Chiang
used us to have Li Dazhao killed.
The communists
will surely remember what we have done.
But in this world of ours
there is no cure for regret.
Attention!
Come,
Salute!
Come, come!
We've seized 5,000 rifles,
700,000 rounds
and captured 3,000 men.
This was a brilliant victory.
Zhang Fakui and Zhu Peide's troops
are marching to Nanchang.
Li Jishen sent Qian Dajun
and his troops from Guangzhou.
Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek's armies are forming an alliance
and a huge net has now been cast.
Nanchang,
we can't hold any longer.
Then we should quickly sweep the battlefield and lead our men south,
take the Chaozhou-Shantou region, and make use of their docks
to gain access to the goods and arms support from the Comintern.
We fight all the way to Guangzhou, gather our strength,
and prepare for the second Northern Expedition
to unite the whole China!
Enlai!
Nie Rongzhen, you are such a bad ass!
You have even delivered to me
Wang Jingwei's reserve force!
Your service is commendable!
From now on, the 25th Division is ours and will fight for us.
My only regret is
I failed to catch the uprising.
Nanchang is only the starting point.
Everything has just begun.
The Comintern considers
Mikhail Borodin and Chen Duxiu's errors to be serious.
They have brought disastrous consequences to China's revolutionary situation.
The suspension of Chen's position as general secretary
is both the decision of the Comintern
and the unanimous request from China's Party's comrades.
In the absence of Chen,
Comrades Qu Qiubai and Li Weihan will be in charge of the Central Committee's work.
A tall figure with long hair.
You must be Mao Zedong?
Big head and small figure...
I assume you are...
Deng Xixian. I just changed my name.
I am Deng Xiaoping now.
Clearly you are highly skilled to have escaped
from He'nan's white terror.
It was a narrow escape. I'll tell you all about it later
and I promise my story will astonish you.
Quick, get in there.
A big quarrel is going on inside.
China is not Turkey.
Since Chiang wants to be Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in China
we are left with no choice
but to firmly take him down.
To fight against Cheng Kai-shek
we must first solve the problems within the party.
The theme of today's meeting
is to criticize Chen Duxiu's right-wing capitulation errors,
correct the Party's working direction,
and deal with the current situation to turn the tide.
We see setbacks as a starting point.
We start over from the very beginning.
Enlai and others lead troops south to Guangzhou
to prepare to rebuild the revolutionary base,
to get rid of those two-faced careerists,
and to launch a new Northern Expedition.
This revolution
is not about the KMT alone.
It is also about communists,
workers, peasants and the masses.
Exactly. A revolution for the masses, for workers and peasants.
You are not a formal representative.
It is not your place to speak.
The Comintern decision is good
but the people they sent here are problematic.
What either Borodin or Manabendra Nath Roy does
is wishful thinking.
Chen Duxiu's mistake is overestimating the KMT.
Thus the Communist Party becomes not the host of the revolution
but merely a guest.
This causes us to lose all initiative.
If not for the military campaign by Enlai and others,
we would not even have the strength to fight back
when they turn their backs on us.
The April 12th Massacre
taught us a lesson:
political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.
Great! Well said!
Zedong,Zedong!
You are a party member with seniority
and your organizational skill can convince the masses.
We all hope you can go to Shanghai.
I'm just a country boy
and I'm not used to the city's tall buildings.
I plan to go back to Hu'nan.
Once the harvest comes,
I will get some guns on the border of Hu'nan and Jiangxi
and do something big.
Can you even go back?
The enemies in Changsha offer a handsome reward for your head
and the landlords would happily watch you be burned alive.
Since the very first day I joined the Party
I have been making every preparation.
Every day people are murdered there.
Even Heaven is shedding tears.
Let it cry. I will do my work.
He who has seen ghosts does not fear darkness,
because he knows well in his heart
that this is darkness before dawn.
I am the Party's General Secretary.
Listen to me and go to Shanghai.
Give it a second thought.
The Central Committee needs you.
Thank you all.
I'm not a communist!
Kaihui,
I think you should take our son and return to Shaoshan.
No.
Nowhere is safe.
More and more are killed every day.
Do you still remember
at Peking University,
when you carried me on your shoulders to watch the fireworks?
I do.
It is my dream that someday
I will watch them with you once again.
But once I leave,
we won't know
when we will meet again.
I'll be waiting for you.
If you don't return after half a year,
I will wait a year.
If not after a year,
I will wait ten years.
If not after ten years,
I will wait a lifetime.
Please just don't say anything.
Dad!
Don't look back.
Go!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Mr. Wang,
in the early morning,
the communists led rebel troops
and launched a fierce attack
on Qian Dajun's troops in Huichang.
The fighting was fierce.
Kill!
At 4p.m.
the rebel troops
occupied Huichang City.
The lower rank officers on both sides
are mostly Huangpu students.
They have the hearts to kill each other?
Charge!
In the end,
they engaged in hand-to-hand combat.
That's preposterous!
What about Qian Dajun?
He broke out,
but lost 5,000 troops.
These troops are under the direct control of Chiang's 1st Army.
Qian Dajun will not let that go.
When shephards quarrel,
the wolf has a winning game.
Ye Ting and Zhou Yiqun's
3rd Division of the 20th Army also suffered heavy causalities.
Cai Tingkai's 10th Division
defected on the battlefield
and left the Communist Party.
Cai Tingkai's defection
is a stunning blow to our troops' morale.
Rumors are spreading like wildfire.
Someone said
the ship was sinking.
Jump first and you survive.
Jump later and you die.
Cai Tingkai's such a bastard.
That bastard is gone
and I, Chen Yi, am here.
I started from Wuhan
and I kept running to catch up with you.
Finally,
I caught up with you in Huichang.
Mr. Zhou!
Commander He, what happened?
This is my application for admission to the Party.
Please grant me my wish!
I, He Long,
will follow the Communist Party
till my last breath!
Hurry!
Watch this red devil for me!
If he gets away, you'll be finished!
I'm going to the toilet.
Get going!
Were you rewarded
for my capture?
Rewarded?
The money is not even enough for the officials to distribute.
How could there be any left for someone as low as me?
Feel right here.
Down.
Take it out and have a look.
Three for each of you.
No more left.
The red devil escaped!
The red devil escaped!
Don't move!
This guy is really weird.
He doesn't say anything.
All he does is eat.
Please don't talk like that.
You captured me and took me here for no reason.
And I don't have a choice.
A big guy's gotta eat more.
Who are you?
Who are you?
National Revolutionary Army
2nd Army
Regiment Guard Commander
Lu Deming.
You can ask Mr. Luo.
Commander Lu,
this is the Central Commissioner,
Comrade Mao Zedong.
Comrade Mao Zedong!
I'm terribly sorry.
No need for that.
No need to apologize.
If you could give me some steamed radish
that would be enough.
Sure.
After we have taken Changsha,
there will be plenty of red stewed pork for you.
You want to attack Changsha?
Yes,
an echo of the Nanchang Uprising
and another heavy blow to those bastards.
To join the uprising movement,
Commander Lu used Zhang Fakui's transfer order
to lead 2,000 Regiment Guards to Nanchang.
But by the time we reached Fengxin County,
all the troops had withdrawn from Nanchang.
So I decided to
conserve our strength and rest here.
And as a result,
you were captured.
We must change our unit designations now.
Change our designations?
Yes and we must make entirely new flags.
No more blue sky, white sun, and red earth?
This Nationalist flag
can't be used anymore.
But we held up this flag
and fought under this flag during the Uprising.
The orphan next door is crying.
Warlords,
landlords, and capitalists
hate the workers' and peasants' armed movement.
They've been ordered by the Nationalists
to embark on a consolidation campaign.
From cities like Wuhan and Shanghai
to towns and villages,
you find everywhere their victims, wailing in despair.
Even Chongyang and Tongcheng Counties
have been completely decimated.
10% of those who joined the peasants' movement
have been executed.
With such atrocities,
how could the people still trust the government?
With such atrocities,
how could we continue to use
this flag and these symbols?
All right.
How should we rank the troops?
Let us use
1st Division, 1st Army of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Army!
Our troops have entered the boundary of Jieyang
and will reach the Chaozhou-Shantou region next.
But they face enemy troops from Guangdong and Guangxi in front.
Qian Dajun is right on their ass.
This dog skin plaster is so tightly attached
that you can't even shake it off.
To win in the Chaozhou-Shantou region,
we must first eliminate Qian Dajun.
I'll set an ambush for them.
We have a shortage of troops
which makes it impossible for us
to divide our forces.
I'm afraid peeling off this plaster with sheer force
might also take off a layer of skin.
I'll be in charge of holding Sanheba district.
They have 30,000 men.
How many soldiers can you give us?
3,000.00
And how many days will you need?
3
After 3 days
I will lead the combat force to meet you
and together we will fight our way to Guangzhou.
As long as I am alive,
Qian Dajun will not cross Sanheba District!
I have this one single question for you all.
Did participating in the Autumn Harvest Uprising
cause you a great deal of suffering?
Will any of you answer my question?
If nobody will answer my question,
I'll take it that none of you suffered.
Right?
If you don't speak up now,
there won't be another chance.
No crying about your suffering.
You hear me or not?
Commander Lu has made the stakes very clear.
In that case, right now we will set a few basic rules.
From now on, whether marching or fighting,
eating or sleeping out in the open air,
you shall not whine about your suffering.
Let me ask you again.
Will you suffer?
Yes!
Everyone, answer me together!
Will you suffer?
Yes!
Louder!
Yes!
We need to move soon.
Go! Move!
Take cover!
Hurry up!
Save the injured!
Save the injured!
Hurry up!
Retreat! Go!
Move!
Move!
Retreat! Go!
Comrade Lu sacrificed himself to give us cover.
He exchanged his life for our bloody lesson:
Large cities can't be attacked
and progressive ideology will not be tolerated.
Now we have only one path ahead of us.
We continue to march to Jinggangshan
to be kings of the mountain.
Use the grass dug up as camouflage.
Trenches should be dug in a V or a U shape.
Trenches should also be dug in the lowest area
to reduce injuries from shrapnel and to drain.
Remember, set up elbow platforms
so that while firing at the enemy
the maximum amount of energy can be saved.
Three rivers converge at Sanheba.
Qian Dajun is stationed on the west bank.
To fight us he must cross the Ting River
and he will land somewhere around here.
Now I will assign to each of you your missions.
Battalion Commander Li,
you set up a defense along the Shizi'an bank
and quietly wait for a chance to ambush.
Cai Qingchuan, Lin Biao and Chen Yi,
you ambush near Shizidong and Longhukeng.
We are short on ammunition, therefore,
no gunshots without my command.
Yes, sir!
Comrades, we are facing a tough battle.
Qian Dajun has 30,000 troops.
We've less than 3,000
and no reinforcements.
So I simply ask one thing from all of you:
no unnecessary sacrifice.
Jinggangshan has 5 wells.
This is the best place for the Worker-Peasant Rev. Army!
Over the past few months
so many communist heads have rolled.
But all of us here are survivors.
What is a survivor?
A survivor is someone
who lives the life of the dead
so that they did not die in vain,
but instead made a valuable sacrifice.
I hear Ye Ting's Independent Regiment built a Party branch
which plays the role of a fort for the Communists
that can't be worn down or destroyed.
This has made them a very capable force.
I think
even the regimental level is not enough.
This should be done on the company level.
Establish a Party representative system,
to have a Party group in a platoon,
Party members in a squad,
and the principle that the Party commands the gun will be implemented.
This point
I will report to the Central Committee in advance.
How can there be enough Party members?
Recruitment is happening now.
Those not afraid of death or not taken by greed,
and are capable of fighting for the poor,
they can be Party members.
Their line of defense stretches over 5 km on the opposite bank.
And we don't yet know where their vulnerabilities lie.
The artillery regiment is ready
and can bombard the opposite bank at anytime.
Have the enemy troops been located?
Send the 4th Regiment to cross the river
and carry out a search.
Report! Enemy has begun their attack!
Report! Enemy has reached the bank along Shizian
and the initial estimate is 2,000 men!
Wait.
Report! Enemy vanguard has landed at Shizian!
I order you to attack!
Lin Biao! Chen Yi!
Attack!
Our beach landing has met fierce resistance
and casualties are heavy!
Fire at the enemy defense line!
But the 4th Regiment is still engaged with the enemy!
Sometimes you gotta make a few sacrifices.
Fire!
Distance 175, to the right 003,
Get ready!
Fire!
Retreat!
Take cover!
Take cover now!
Take cover!
Get ready!
Fire!
Hurry!
Into the trench!
Hurry!
Now!
Into the trench!
Go!
Fire!
Everybody hide in the craters!
Why did we stop?
Keep firing! Now!
Report, Commander,
we've run out of shells.
What do you mean you're out?
We had a logistical problem,
more shells will arrive in 2 days.
Hurry! Save them!
Mom, I miss home!
I want to go home!
I don't want to die.
Mom, I'm so scared!
The battle raged the entire day
and we consumed a large amount of munitions.
All the soldiers in 3rd Company are dead.
Facing the enemy's attack tomorrow,
I don't know if we will be able to hold.
Here, collect the munitions!
And those too!
Go! Retreat!
Report! 1st Army has landed at Shizian and is in pursuit.
They will drive straight to Longhukeng!
You're in charge here.
Go!
Fire!
Report! 1st Regiment was ambushed at Longhukeng!
Report!
3rd Regiment has reached east bank
and is driving straight to main position!
2nd Regiment has begun their offensive!
Attack!
Grenade!
The machine-gun is silent! The machine-gun!
I'll go!
Grenade!
Gather all the weapons and munitions,
disarm the captives and take them away!
Yes, sir!
Hurry! Another assault is coming! Move!
Pick up the ammo!
Save the injured! Hurry!
Now we are down to less than two thousand men
and all the ambush positions have been exposed.
There is still one more day to hold.
What the hell should I do?
Nobody!
Commander Qian,
is it okay? How about this?
Comrades,
we have been fighting alone these past few days.
Many of our brothers have been sacrificed.
Facing our fallen brothers today
I, Zhu De, am filled with guilt.
However,
the precious time bought with our lives
grants the surviving opportunities for our main force.
Tell me,
is it worth it or not?
Yes!
The blocking mission is complete
and we are retreating from Sanheba.
On the opposite bank, Qian Dajun
is not going to let us out of here easily.
So I have decided
that 200 men will stay behind
to make our final stand against Qian Dajun
to help more people get out alive.
There is little hope for survival for those that stay.
Therefore,
if both father and son serve in the army,
the son leaves with the rest of the team.
If both older and younger brothers serve in the army,
the older brother stays.
Everyone, remember. The revolutionary road is long
and we are here to leave seeds for China's revolution.
I am the 11th Army, 25th Division, 73rd Regiment,
3rd Battalion Commander, Cai Qingchuan.
I request to stay.
11th Army, 24th Division, 72nd Regiment Commander,
Sun Shucheng,
is willing to stay and make a final stand.
Chen Yi, political director,
will stay and fight!
Report!
I am an orphan
and I am willing to stay!
I will stay!
I want to stay!
I should stay!
Brother!
I will stay!
Sit down!
We will all stay and fight!
Go back!
Listen to me,
you must preserve your lives!
The revolutionary needs you.
You are the hope for a new China!
Understand?
Be a warrior
but not a martyr!
Return alive!
Yes, sir!
Salute!
Send my order. Capture Sanheba within one hour!
Comrades, we have only one mission.
Hold Sanheba to buy time for the main force to retreat.
Heaven is waiting for you!
Get ready!
Yes, sir!
Kill!
Be a warrior
but not a martyr!
Be a warrior
but not a martyr!
Be a warrior
but not a martyr!
Liu Song!
Hurry!
The detonator!
Right turn!
Salute!
Give everyone from Huangpu
an elaborate funeral.
You the 73rd Regiment?
You the 73rd Regiment?
Su Yu,
you are late.
Sanheba...
You didn't see...
How is it on your side?
Our main force was ambushed
in the Chaozhou-Shantou region.
So many men
were killed this way?
What happened?
Where is the main force now?
There were just too many of them.
We fired every single bullet we had.
Commander Ye Ting and He Long
both broke through and are now missing.
Comrade Zhou Enlai became very ill
and was sent to Hong Kong.
We have failed.
Someday,
we will avenge all the martyrs we have lost.
I promise you that I will seize Nanjing
and destroy our enemies.
Su Yu, return to your unit!
Yes, sir!
73rd Regiment, assemble!
Attention!
Comrades,
Chiang Kai-shek has betrayed the revolution
and has slaughtered the revolutionaries.
Now we have no choice but to launch this revolt.
The Nanchang Insurrection
is proof to the entire world
that we are still alive.
Constant fighting has caused
our once great army of 20,000 strong,
to be reduced to 800.
These souls baptized by fire,
will merge with people's destiny.
From now on, people will believe us,
support us
and fight together for the establishment of a new China.
In the past, I was a Nationalist lieutenant general
From today
I am just like you,
a new soldier of the revolutionary army.
Everything we do today
is with the highest honor!
Yes!
Zhu De disappeared.
Mao Zedong vanished.
Zhou Enlai, He Long,
Ye Ting... nearly all of them are nowhere to be found.
Music.
Even if they are still alive,
they are like wandering ghosts
and their days are numbered.
The Party members' reinvestigation,
how is it going?
The report says it's going very smoothly.
Before the purging, we had more than 1 million members
and after re-registration we have 700,000.
When did those Communist dogs gain 300,000 new members?
Not that many.
Quite a few old members did not register again.
So in other words, they were automatically withdrawn from the Nationalist Party.
Commander in Chief,
Madam, water.
According to the report,
nearly half all members have quit the party
and new members
from various places have filled in.
What kind of people are they?
Local tyrants, evil gentry, bandits and despots.
Mao Zedong, a peasant.
Zhu De, an army riffraff.
Zhou Enlai, an intellectual.
What do they have to rival me?
In 10 years,
let's see which side still has its flag waving high!
Mr. Zhou,
Madam Deng has commanded
that you must take time to rest.
Zhu De finally broke through several blockades
and is leading his troops
to the boundary of Hu'nan and Jiangxi
to meet Mao Zedong's troops.
Mao Zedong has troops as well?
Over the past few years
Mao Zedong has traveled through Hu'nan's villages
studying China's conditions.
After leaving Wuhan,
he went to the border of Hu'nan and Jiangxi
and established an armed force of workers and peasants.
Now they are together
and a hope is born for China's future.
China's revolution
still depends on you.
It depends on many people.
Zhu De, He Long, Ye Ting,
and thousands of generals and soldiers.
Well, this body of mine has failed me.
At this critical moment
I must recuperate in Hong Kong.
During the Huangma Uprising, Pan Zhongru, Cao Xuekai and others
fought and won a little piece of heaven on earth.
I hear He Long is doing quite well in western Hu'nan.
It's impressive.
In the New Year's eve uprising in South Hu'nan,
Commander Zhu gathered a force of more than 10,000 men.
Xu Xiangqian led the workers' red guards
and joined an uprising in Guangzhou.
Peng Dehuai is also planning an uprising in Pingjiang County, Hu'nan.
I heard that
Zhu De is leading his troops to come to Jinggangshan.
That's right.
I can hardly wait.
Commissioner Mao,
the comrades who joined the uprising in South Hu'nan are here.
Zhu De is here as well.
Come, let us welcome them!
Comrade Zhu De,
after the failure in the Chaozhou-Shantou Region,
your army had a bloody battle in Sanheba alone.
And after marching for thousands of miles,
800 defeated men became a force of more than 10,000 strong.
The pillar of strength in our revolution
has been no one but you!
I have long heard of you and your work, Zedong.
To establish a base in barren mountains that range for miles and miles,
is something only a hero could achieve.
I have eight words hidden in my heart:
"So many extreme difficulties and a narrow escape."
I also have 8 words for you,
for Dr. Sun Yat-sen,
for Chiang Kai-shek and for all of our enemies:
"A single spark
can start a wild fire."
Salute!
The new China
depends on you!
"In September 1927, Mao Zedong led the famous Sanwan Reorganization,
"which founded the system under the leadership of the CCP.
"In December 1929, the Fourth Red Army held the 9th meeting of the CCP,
"which saw the adoption of the Gutian Congress Resolution,
"established the principle to build the Party ideologically and the Army politically
"and pointed the way to construct a new proletarian People's Army.
"The Red Army had thus entered into a new era and began to develop and grow."
The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army
is an armed body that can carry out the political tasks of the revolution.
This is the valuable experience
we gathered from our bitter struggles.
Well said!
I, Zhu De, hereby bear witness.
I as well!
I also!
The Red Army
is the people's army.
Besides fighting to destroy the enemy's military strength,
it should shoulder such important tasks
as providing propaganda to the people,
organizing the masses,
and arming them. These are it's primary duties.
The central task and the highest form of revolution
is the seizure of power by an armed force.
We will arm our troops
with proletarian ideology
as a force to correct all errant ideas.
Our principle is that
the Party commands the gun.
