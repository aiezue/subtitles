1
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,070
For thousands of years China was a first class world power.

2
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,190
Why has China declined

3
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,870
to such a degree?

4
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,550
Because we, the Chinese people, have been asleep.

5
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,150
Down with the military government!

6
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,830
No disarming! No surrender!

7
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,350
Protect the Shanghai worker's movement!

8
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,750
Down with the warlords!

9
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,790
Down with the military government!

10
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,190
No disarming! No surrender!

11
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,830
Protect the Shanghai worker's movement!

12
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,150
Down with the warlords!

13
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,070
Down with the military government!

14
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,590
No disarming! No surrender!

15
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,190
Protect the Shanghai worker's movement!

16
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,390
Down with the warlords!

17
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,590
Down with the military government!

18
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,750
No disarming! No surrender!

19
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,670
Move! This is a peaceful demonstration!

20
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,590
What are you doing?

21
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,580
Why would you shoot at us?

22
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,710
This is a peaceful demonstration!

23
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,550
Ready,

24
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,390
fire!

25
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,830
Director Zhou!

26
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,710
Si Li!

27
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,270
Am I, Zhou Enlai, being the target?

28
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,030
No way.

29
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,190
The situation is not safe.

30
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,630
My brother said your safety must be guaranteed.

31
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,550
This way.

32
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,750
Where is Mr. Du?

33
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,150
He has been waiting a long time for you inside.

34
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,820
I'm three minutes early.

35
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,990
The worker's militia was sent by the trade association.

36
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,790
Today the workers have guns.

37
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,670
Tomorrow the peasants will want guns too.

38
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,590
What good is the army?

39
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,000
The worker's uprising

40
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,650
overthrew the Beiyang government in Shanghai

41
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,630
and should be credited for the revolution!

42
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,340
I am a soldier

43
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,750
and it is my duty to obey commands.

44
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,590
Was the command from Wang Jingwei?

45
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,590
No.

46
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,260
Then from whom?

47
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,830
I will say it one more time.

48
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,870
Apologize to us

49
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,830
and return the worker's militia's guns.

50
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,590
These are our two basic conditions.

51
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,060
This speech,

52
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,990
I'm afraid, shouldn't come from me.

53
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,430
Then who on earth should it come from?

54
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,420
Some things must be stated clearly!

55
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,950
You can't become president of the Shangai Labor Union anymore.

56
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,590
Come and work for me

57
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,710
and I'll give you a few bars of gold every month

58
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,510
to feed your family.

59
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,990
You should know well

60
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,070
what kind of man I am.

61
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,750
I do. I do know.

62
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,190
You got rid of the Beiyang government

63
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,790
in Shanghai with just a few battered rifles.

64
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,830
Your whole life is ahead of you and your potential is limitless.

65
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,670
Please wait.

66
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,230
This is what you get for harboring the worker's militia!

67
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,900
Wang Shouhua,

68
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,670
I have the utmost respect for you.

69
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,270
So please, you must take this cup of wine.

70
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,070
First, a toast to your good self.

71
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,870
Second, a toast to your faith.

72
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,510
Third, a toast to your perseverance.

73
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,860
Chop them up!

74
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,910
You commie! Write something now!

75
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,060
I asked you to write something!

76
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,830
I, Zhou Enlai, am never leery of my friends.

77
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,390
Si Lie...

78
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,310
You can stop now; it's not too late.

79
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,030
I have no authority or influence here.

80
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,110
Back when you sent your brother to the Huangpu Military Academy,

81
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,230
we recited Dr. Sun Yat-sen's admonition together.

82
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,380
Do you remember?

83
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,790
The Three Principles of the People.

84
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,710
"Our aim shall be:

85
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,070
To found a free land,

86
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,030
World peace, be our stand.

87
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,070
Lead on, comrades,

88
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,150
Vanguards ye are.

89
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,350
Hold fast your aim,

90
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,510
By sun and star."

91
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,230
You wept then.

92
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,660
But less than 3 years later

93
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,830
you've turned your back on your beliefs.

94
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,300
Toppling the foreign powers in China,

95
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,270
uniting the entire country,

96
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,750
and rebuilding the republic.

97
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,550
These are the lifelong ideals of Dr. Sun.

98
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,030
But you've turned your gun on your brother

99
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,310
before the Northern Expedition has even finished.

100
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,590
That was not my intention at all.

101
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,660
I've told you. I am a soldier

102
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,870
and I follow orders.

103
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,860
Orders from whom?

104
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,780
The Nationalist Government in Wuhan,

105
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,020
the Beiyang Government in Beiping

106
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,340
or the Nanjing Military Government Chiang Kai-shek wants to found?

107
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,710
Three governments in one country

108
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,030
and you say the country's not splitting?

109
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,830
You still say it's not a betrayal to Dr. Sun?

110
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,430
Chairman Wang Jingwei and General Secretary Chen Duxiu

111
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,550
issued a joint statement calling for strength, unity, and cooperation.

112
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,110
Si Lie,

113
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,190
you're being used as cannon fodder by careerists!

114
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,940
When the circumstances change,

115
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,630
have you thought about how things will end for you?

116
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,390
Please enlighten me, Mr. Zhou.

117
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,870
I have served with Commander-in-Chief Chiang for several years.

118
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,070
I know a thing or two about him.

119
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,590
When Wuhan began to bring those responsible to account,

120
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,870
would he have helped you escape?

121
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,870
Mr. Zhou,

122
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,870
there was no way around

123
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,790
offending you today.

124
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,110
When I see you again,

125
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,830
I will offer you my sincerest apology.

126
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,870
Dismissed!

127
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,150
Thank you for your advice.

128
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,230
Sir.

129
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,510
"Take down the military dictatorship.

130
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,350
"Chiang Kai-shek Orders to Dismiss the Political Departments in the Armies.

131
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,950
"Revolution has yet to succeed; Comrades must still exert themselves."

132
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,310
Commander-in-Chief, express telegram from Beijing.

133
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,030
Read it

134
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,310
Zhang Zuolin arrested Li Dazhao in the Russian Embassy

135
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,070
and he's asking what should be done about him.

136
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,110
Well, he certainly knows how to shift responsibility

137
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,950
by asking my opinion.

138
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,510
What did he say?

139
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,780
"Li Dazhao

140
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,430
is the leader of the Northern Branch of KMT.

141
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,940
He lives in the capital in secret

142
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,150
and colludes with foreigners.

143
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,790
He's now caught in the act.

144
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,150
What should be done with him?"

145
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,220
Send Zhang a telegram and say

146
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,540
the Party is being purged

147
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,230
and the suspect is no longer a member of the Nationalist Party.

148
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,590
As his case relates to foreign affairs,

149
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,420
it's recommended he be tried soon

150
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,260
and then executed

151
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,030
to avoid further ado.

152
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,150
If we keep this up,

153
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,670
the revolution will be wiped out

154
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,670
and the Communist Party will be destroyed.

155
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,020
We have to show our cards

156
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,190
and voice the most rigorous protest.

157
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,790
I ought to write articles

158
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,870
and expose the true colors of that bastard Chiang Kai-shek.

159
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,110
Soldier boy...

160
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,030
New here?

161
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,900
You look like a baby.

162
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,140
I'm clearly older than you.

163
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,830
I was born in the Year of the Goat.

164
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,910
So was I.

165
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,750
Which month?

166
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,510
December.

167
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,670
I'm August.

168
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:35,990
Call me big brother.

169
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,230
Like hell I will.

170
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,990
What are you talking about?

171
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,380
This would be suicidal.

172
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,270
Wang Jingwei doesn't know what to do.

173
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,310
Wuhan

174
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,190
has a storm on the horizon.

175
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,740
Let us hear Comrade Chen Duxiu's opinion.

176
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,030
The forces amassed by the workers and peasants over the years

177
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,110
were slaughtered by more than half on a single day.

178
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,190
As the Party's general secretary, I feel the most pain.

179
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,270
The Communist Party and the Nationalist Party had an agreement

180
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,820
to form a united front

181
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,870
in the revolution together.

182
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,730
But Chiang Kai-shek

183
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,630
now uses the weapons supplied by the Comintern

184
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,390
to slaughter us.

185
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,750
We have to arm ourselves

186
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,950
and fight this aggression.

187
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,270
Indeed we must fight.

188
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,790
Our blood must not be shed in vain.

189
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,190
Confronting the enemy head on

190
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,110
puts us at a disadvantage.

191
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,500
But giving them free reign

192
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,550
is out of the question.

193
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,950
We have only one option:

194
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,070
Hand over our weapons immediately.

195
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,070
Our weapons?

196
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,790
Why give them our weapons?

197
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,270
Be quiet!

198
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,710
Why give them our weapons?

199
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,080
Because we don't have a lot of guns to hand over in the first place.

200
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,630
Since we hardly have any guns already,

201
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,750
what's the harm in handing them all over?

202
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,270
Once we give them up

203
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,660
we become like sheep

204
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,270
that anyone could slaughter at will.

205
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,830
Wang Jingwei and his Wuhan government

206
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,430
are sympathetic to communists

207
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,750
and the revolution.

208
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,870
If all the armed workers and peasants

209
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,350
in this country

210
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,070
handed over all their weapons,

211
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,630
Chiang Kai-shek would have no excuse to harm us

212
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,670
and Wang Jingwei would try his best to help us.

213
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,180
China faces a crisis

214
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,230
and our hope should continue to rest in...

215
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,270
continue to rest in...

216
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,140
Wang Jingwei now wants to get in bed with Chiang Kai-shek

217
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,950
and this is their conspiracy!

218
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,140
We can't trust them!

219
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,830
What happened?

220
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,190
Comrade Li Dazhao

221
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,870
was murdered

222
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,510
by warlords.

223
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,030
Not a single rifle can be surrendered.

224
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,510
If we do, our fate as communists

225
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,820
will be the same as Li Dazhao!

226
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,030
Zedong, it's not the turn of the Hu'nan representatives to speak!

227
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,630
Can we rely on the Wang Jingwei government?

228
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,150
No, we can't!

229
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,990
And it would be suicide for us to hand over our guns!

230
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,950
We have only one way to go

231
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,150
and that is armed struggle!

232
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,590
We once criticized Sun Yat-sen for engaging exclusively in armed campaigns.

233
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,510
But what about us?

234
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,350
We reach for the pen and ignore the rifle.

235
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,820
And in the end we will only usher in a massacre.

236
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,150
Yes.

237
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,950
You are just being an alarmist!

238
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,990
Chen Duxiu, you and Mr. Li walked out in front of the revolution

239
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,910
and now you want to surrender our arms. Why?

240
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,830
I will do it to protect the working class

241
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,150
and grow the revolutionary forces.

242
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,670
This is just some contrived measure!

243
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,390
How many workers are there in China?

244
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,310
Very few.

245
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,550
Our country is mainly comprised of peasants.

246
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,510
Such a backwards class of people.

247
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,030
Once the land issues are solved

248
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,190
and the peasants are armed,

249
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,190
they become the capital for our revolution

250
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,990
as well as our largest force.

251
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,230
Do you understand any of this?

252
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,630
Right now I don't,

253
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,430
but I will in the future.

254
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,670
Get out!

255
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,790
How dare you distort Marxism?

256
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,910
Who do you think you are?

257
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:36,950
Zedong!

258
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,390
Mao, get out now!

259
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,790
Get out!

260
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,910
Comrade Wang Shouhua,

261
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,030
today is the 49th day since you

262
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,740
and your 300 comrades died on April 12.

263
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,310
I hereby pledge

264
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,190
that for the realization of our glorious common ideal

265
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,990
to found a new China,

266
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,390
I, Zhou Enlai, will fight for the rest of my life

267
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,990
and stay devoted

268
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,910
till my heart ceases to beat.

269
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,070
You were elected a member of the Political Bureau at the 5th CPC National Congress.

270
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,990
The Congress decided to

271
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,980
suspend the Military Department

272
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,510
and organize the Central Military Commission

273
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:49,950
with you as the general secretary.

274
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,750
Mao Zedong made a good point.

275
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,910
What did he say?

276
00:24:59,080 --> 00:24:59,910
He spoke the truth.

277
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,030
He was in charge of mobilizing peasants in Guangzhou

278
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:02,910
and I didn't know

279
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,000
he had such a unique opinion on armed struggles.

280
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,030
He wrote "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement In Hunan"

281
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,870
and has a deep understanding of China's situation.

282
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,790
We also need to maintain our path of urban struggles.

283
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,310
Fighting with two fists

284
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,790
is the only way to overwhelm the enemy.

285
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,190
Yingchao,

286
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,830
pack up.

287
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,630
We are going to Wuhan.

288
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,430
Wuhan?

289
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,670
You came to see me as soon as you reached Wuhan.

290
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,340
Do you have an emergency?

291
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,790
I read your speech

292
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,990
and really wanted to speak with you.

293
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,550
We should smokeless

294
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,750
and learn more.

295
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,320
Right now the Party needs to hear your voice.

296
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,390
I have already been driven out

297
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,670
and no one is willing to listen to me anymore.

298
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,070
But I am a communist and I'm willing to listen.

299
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,100
See, am I not here for you already?

300
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,750
Cigarettes are such a wonderful thing.

301
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,990
It would be terrible to not know how to smoke them.

302
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,030
But once you know how,

303
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,910
they make you feel like an immortal.

304
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,190
They are just like a weapon.

305
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,950
They bring hope in good hands

306
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,230
and disaster in bad.

307
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,830
April 12 was a bloody lesson.

308
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,590
Almost all the armed forces in Shanghai were lost

309
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,270
and I am responsible.

310
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:50,790
In Sichuan,

311
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,590
He'nan,

312
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,910
Hubei and Guangdong,

313
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,510
they are still purging the communists.

314
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,990
This is because our power is still being weakened.

315
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,830
We should have no more illusions.

316
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,710
If we still want to continue our revolution

317
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,390
we have to create an army with revolutionary faith.

318
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,910
But now is the low tide of the revolution.

319
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,150
Don't lose heart.

320
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,150
We have millions of troops.

321
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,310
Can't you see them?

322
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,270
From where?

323
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,390
Peasants.

324
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,750
China has four hundred million peasants.

325
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,070
For generations

326
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,790
they have been bullied by the landlords and the rich

327
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,670
and have suffered a great deal.

328
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,350
They are like dry kindling covering the ground.

329
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,070
All it takes is a spark

330
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,870
and there will be a devouring fire.

331
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,750
Few peasant uprisings have succeeded

332
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,060
throughout history.

333
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,030
You and your comrades who have studied overseas,

334
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,750
praise the example set by the French Revolution

335
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,350
and the method of urban riots.

336
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,270
The working class is the main body of the revolution.

337
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,510
This is the general view of Marx, right?

338
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,630
I think China is different.

339
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,820
We may lack the experience

340
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,910
but we don't lack the courage to try.

341
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,910
Starting from where?

342
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,020
From zero, of course.

343
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,750
Find people if we have no one, and buy guns if we have no guns.

344
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,670
I'll go persuade the army.

345
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,070
I'll mobilize the peasants.

346
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,780
Last year in the Zhongshan Incident,

347
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,910
we stood together.

348
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,750
Now we stand together once more.

349
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,150
If what we're experiencing now is a failure,

350
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,110
then we communists...

351
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,870
We will continue to rise again and again.

352
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,870
Too wet.

353
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,190
Feng Yuxiang...

354
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,190
Is he going to lobby for Chiang?

355
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,350
I'm worried they have made a secret agreement.

356
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,230
The trouble is not Feng

357
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,550
but the communists.

358
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,990
Are you concerned they may start a rebellion?

359
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,870
"Cable from the Comintern."

360
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,350
Look at this. This was just intercepted.

361
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,740
You are right.

362
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,150
Ye Jianying,

363
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,380
can you pinpoint the information's source?

364
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,270
Yes.

365
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,950
Wang Jingwei and his men intercepted a cable

366
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,230
from the Comintern giving permission to Communists to begin an armed struggle.

367
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,630
Chiang slaughters us

368
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,550
and Wang Jingwei wants to join.

369
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,830
Then let's fight!

370
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,110
We can't fight them head on. We must save our strength.

371
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,710
Those comrades whose identities have been exposed

372
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,910
must leave Wuhan immediately.

373
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,630
Ye Ting,

374
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,150
lead the 11th Army to leave the city

375
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,230
and head east to Jiujiang.

376
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:47,790
Yes, sir.

377
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,110
Actually,

378
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,990
there is still one person we can win over.

379
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,750
You mean Zhang Fakui?

380
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,190
He only sympathizes with us verbally,

381
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,510
but his heart lies on Wang Jingwei's side.

382
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,030
I was referring to the commander of the 20th Army,

383
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,550
He Long.

384
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,030
General,

385
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,110
you run into a problem?

386
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,310
Your eyes gave it away.

387
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,790
Yeah.

388
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,870
I ran into a few.

389
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,350
There are still two we are facing.

390
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,670
Who are they?

391
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,590
Ye Ting...

392
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,390
His troops have the nickname of

393
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,870
the "Iron Army."

394
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,260
I met him once.

395
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,150
He is a hero.

396
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,190
Miss,

397
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,990
the true hero

398
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,740
is right in front of you.

399
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,710
All right. All right.

400
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,100
Who is the other problem?

401
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,390
He Long...

402
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,670
Unlike us, he didn't graduate from Huangpu.

403
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,190
In western Hu'nan he has built an army with two kitchen knives.

404
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,750
He began his Northern Expedition alone

405
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,230
and handed the Beiyang army a string of defeats.

406
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:57,870
Commander He,

407
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,390
in addition to this silver

408
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,150
and the post of Wuhan Garrison Commander,

409
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,110
we also offer what any officer would want the most.

410
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,710
You can promise Ye Ting's post to He Long,

411
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,630
and let them battle it out like two animals in a cage.

412
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,110
Then He Long will offer to come work for you.

413
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,310
Two birds with one stone.

414
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,670
Good.

415
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,180
Thanks.

416
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,710
The chips Mr. Chiang has offered

417
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,340
are expensive indeed.

418
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,870
What I advocate the most

419
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,550
is a full arsenal.

420
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,310
Then, please make your decision, Commander He.

421
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,350
I am right here for you to arrest.

422
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,830
I, He Long, may be illiterate.

423
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,350
But regarding which friend is worth having

424
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,350
and which is a scoundrel,

425
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,870
I can tell the difference.

426
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,270
So are we communists.

427
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,910
Maybe not.

428
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,950
Multiple times I offered to join you

429
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,300
but you turned me away.

430
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,350
Who turned you away?

431
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,270
Zhang Guotao!

432
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,430
This man is extremely arrogant

433
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,780
and has labelled me a bandit.

434
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,990
Am I a bandit?

435
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,110
I'm a soldier!

436
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,140
He has a good point.

437
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,630
You are always yelling to fight and to kill.

438
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,270
Fight?

439
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,310
Would you sit back with your arms folded

440
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,830
while the poor are bullied?

441
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,670
If you turn a blind eye

442
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,950
when they are bullied, you are an accomplice.

443
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,150
You fight for others' justice

444
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,950
but you can save only a few at most.

445
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,070
We communists want to fight for everyone's justice

446
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,870
and change millions of our people's lives.

447
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,220
That's exactly right.

448
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,830
I would not embark on

449
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,390
that evil ship with Chiang.

450
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,510
As for the gifts,

451
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,590
I will take care of them.

452
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,380
It's a shame we don't have

453
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,910
the Hanyang Arsenal.

454
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,510
Otherwise we'd have all the guns

455
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,510
and cannons we could want.

456
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,550
We would kick those bastards' asses

457
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,510
so they would cry for their mothers.

458
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,710
Chiang and Wang have split with the communists

459
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,510
and the world now sees communists as a threat.

460
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,830
In such a critical moment, Commander He knows so clearly what is right.

461
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,110
You are the kind of friend I must have.

462
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,140
A friend like you

463
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,420
is also what I need.

464
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,870
Anything else?

465
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,830
The Mosin-Nagans...

466
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,550
I can't get those.

467
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,190
That's what the Red Russians gave the Cantonese.

468
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,700
We would lose our heads

469
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,910
if we smuggled those out.

470
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,910
Have you served in the army?

471
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,070
I served for a few days.

472
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,510
I want all these guns.

473
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,630
I don't accept Canton Bank notes.

474
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,270
You have to pay in silver dollars.

475
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,510
That's not enough.

476
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,590
Here, take this.

477
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,350
That can be enough.

478
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,670
As a token of our friendship.

479
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,990
Also deliver the goods to Manager Luo.

480
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,380
Manager Luo you say.

481
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,710
Do you mean Luo Ronghuan?

482
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,430
Correct.

483
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,030
Then I know what you're doing.

484
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,870
You can keep the money

485
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,510
as well as the guns.

486
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,830
You are doing something big.

487
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,390
I'm keeping this watch

488
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,670
as the bond between us.

489
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,060
You are a hero

490
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,430
and I admire you.

491
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,340
The Nationalist Government is willing to accommodate you with the utmost sincerity.

492
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,270
United we stand. Divided we fall.

493
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,390
The Nationalist Government reaffirms

494
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,190
that any force attempting to thwart the Northern Expedition revolution will be...

495
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,670
Both Chiang and Wang were students of Dr. Sun Yat-sen.

496
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,910
Nobody expected they would betray the revolution one after the other.

497
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,670
This has had a chilling effect.

498
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,300
We will not give up.

499
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,830
The communists will remember forever

500
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,110
our intentions to follow Dr. Sun's revolutionary path.

501
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,950
I hope you can maintain this youthful zeal forever.

502
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,180
China's future

503
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,630
depends on you.

504
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:28,830
Madam,

505
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,630
I am here to say goodbye to you.

506
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,790
Where are you going?

507
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,830
Jiangxi

508
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,310
and then Guangdong.

509
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,390
To rekindle the spark of the revolution,

510
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,390
we must organize our own troops.

511
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,430
If it's necessary,

512
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,270
feel free to use my name

513
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,630
so that more people will support you.

514
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,150
No,

515
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,550
support us.

516
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,350
Fakui,

517
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,990
the communists see me as the last Emperor Shizong of Later Zhou.

518
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,560
And you as Zhao Kuangyin, his trusted general who robbed him of the empire.

519
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,220
Chairman Wang is fond of a joke.

520
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,230
Military men don't talk about politics.

521
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,190
All the communist soldiers are under your command.

522
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,030
That Ye Ting...

523
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,030
When the conditions are right there will be a coup

524
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,950
and the Nationalist Government's Chairmanship

525
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,750
will be yours sooner or later.

526
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,350
Chairman Wang,

527
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,390
it's not appropriate for you to say so.

528
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,270
I am not that kind of man.

529
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,420
As for how faithful I am to the Nationalist's Government,

530
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,350
it is there for all to see.

531
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,070
Then send a telegram

532
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,990
calling Ye Ting onto Lushan Mountain and let us confront him.

533
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,430
If he truly dares to rebel,

534
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,830
I will drown him with my own hands.

535
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,980
We can call him to the mountain for a military conference.

536
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,710
Then, that commander from the 20th Army...

537
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,190
He Long is not a communist.

538
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,710
Forget about it if there are real difficulties.

539
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,270
Don't underestimate the skill of sewing.

540
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,550
Sometimes

541
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,230
it's more important than firing a gun.

542
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:40,950
All finished.

543
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,190
Let me see.

544
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,910
Who taught you this?

545
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,750
Lady!

546
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,430
Lady! Who taught you this, Lady?

547
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,710
My morn did when I was little.

548
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,990
So you are a little girl!

549
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,990
A little skill never hurts anybody.

550
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,300
Haven't you heard of such a saying?

551
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:10,870
Watch me!

552
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,670
So you mean

553
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,350
this Lushan Conference is some kind of a trick?

554
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,030
Wang Jingwei wouldn't dare to seize your military power so openly

555
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,380
for fear it will cause a mutiny.

556
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,270
The Lushan Conference is just a ruse.

557
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,390
Once you leave your troops and go up the hill,

558
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,310
you'll become like teethless tigers

559
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,230
and you'll be bullied like sick cats.

560
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,620
Some kind of ambush.

561
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,230
I don't think it would be easy

562
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,190
to pull out my teeth, huh?

563
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,990
Here, try some.

564
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,030
Hey Boatsman,

565
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,910
nice congee.

566
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,630
Comrade Ye Ting taught me well.

567
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,630
You're not too bad at flattery either.

568
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,700
He really taught me well.

569
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,430
Su Yu!

570
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,510
Yes, sir.

571
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,030
Come,

572
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:00,950
have some congee.

573
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,030
Thank you.

574
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,950
At this point we can't return to Wuhan,

575
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,700
and if we head east

576
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,110
we'll be forced to confront Chiang Kai-shek head-on.

577
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,550
It is not wise for our troops to stay in Jiujiang.

578
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,390
Now at this crucial moment

579
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,590
this Zhang Fakui has become the reactionaries' lackey.

580
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,150
What we do next will not be easy.

581
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,150
What are you talking about?

582
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:21,830
Oh I apologize.

583
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,430
We are accustomed to speaking Cantonese among ourselves.

584
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,630
We're talking about where the army will be going.

585
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,550
Where then?

586
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,700
To Nanchang.

587
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,540
The Central Committee has decided

588
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,910
to stage an uprising in Nanchang.

589
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,950
The enemy has only 6,000 troops in Nanchang

590
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,790
and our 11th Army and 20th Army

591
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,070
together command a total of 20,000 troops.

592
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,670
We hold an absolute advantage.

593
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,870
Nanchang

594
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,630
has Chiang Kai-shek to the east,

595
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,430
Wang Jingwei to the west

596
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,830
and Zhang Fakui to the north.

597
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,550
All three are at war with one another

598
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,870
and none of them will send in troops

599
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,670
once we begin to act.

600
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,190
Besides,

601
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,590
in Nanchang City

602
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,820
we still have a Zhu De.

603
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,590
Zhu De?

604
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,020
Is he the guy who went to Berlin looking for the Communist Party?

605
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,110
I don't need to go that far.

606
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,110
I am right here looking for the Party.

607
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,990
After the uprising,

608
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,670
I will sponsor you to become a Party member.

609
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,910
Why don't I take this job?

610
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,710
You need a sponsor to join the Party?

611
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,830
This is a provision of the Party's Constitution.

612
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,590
All right.

613
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,590
Regardless of who my sponsor is,

614
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:20,910
I request

615
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,230
to be stationed on the frontlines.

616
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:24,910
Comrades,

617
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,860
Nanchang is only the beginning.

618
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,590
Our goal is to fight all the way back to Guangzhou,

619
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,110
assemble our forces,

620
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,150
and launch a new Northern Expedition

621
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,660
to unify China.

622
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,300
Commander Ye, Report.

623
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,630
I am the Colonel for the Nanchang City Garrison,

624
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,430
Chen Feng.

625
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,580
If I may enquire, sir.

626
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,390
Speak.

627
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,780
What, may I ask, is the purpose of your troops' coming to Nanchang City?

628
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,510
To head east to face Chiang Kai-shek.

629
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,150
Commander Ye, Report.

630
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,270
Our troops have not received any command.

631
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,340
This is the command.

632
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,350
As my job requires...

633
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,150
Attention!

634
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,830
Welcome the "Iron Army" of the Northern Expedition to enter the city!

635
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,230
Welcome the "Iron Army" of the Northern Expedition to enter the city!

636
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,070
Wang Jingwei's telegram to purge the communists

637
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,990
indicates he is on our side.

638
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,630
But some generals support him as China's leader.

639
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,900
We must be cautious.

640
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,630
He will not become someone significant.

641
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,110
The ones I really worry about are Ye Ting,

642
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,510
He Long

643
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,790
and Zhou Enlai.

644
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,060
Right now these three

645
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,270
can't bring too much chaos.

646
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,070
There are many competent men

647
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,390
surrounding Zhou Enlai.

648
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,510
You must be careful.

649
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,670
I understand.

650
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,430
By the way.

651
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,870
Have the gifts for Miss Mei-ling

652
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,430
been prepared?

653
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,990
They have all been sent to Shanghai.

654
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,230
Well, Miss Mei-ling

655
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,750
prefers plane trees

656
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,350
and wants Nanjing

657
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,860
to be full of them.

658
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,310
I have arranged people to implement your gorgeous plan.

659
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:52,990
Also,

660
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,900
the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Consortium

661
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,110
must be brought into the fold.

662
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,870
Our success relies 30% on military and 70% on the economy.

663
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,750
The country will be at peace

664
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,340
as long those old guys are fed well.

665
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,070
Yes, sir.

666
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,390
With this

667
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,150
we can change the colors of the whole world.

668
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,190
Luo Ronghuan,

669
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,190
don't you think so?

670
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,070
Enlai!

671
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,430
You treated me to wine in Berlin

672
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,880
and now I bring you a jar of liquor from your hometown.

673
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,190
How many people do you have under your control?

674
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,390
A few hundred, I guess.

675
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,670
During the uprising

676
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,070
I need you to eliminate one regiment.

677
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,740
Only one regiment?

678
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,750
We could take on an entire division easily.

679
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,500
I do have some conditions I would like to address.

680
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,150
Say it.

681
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,430
When I joined the Party

682
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,110
all of my money went to Party dues

683
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,580
and I need funds to finance this mission.

684
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,590
Tell me how you will use the money.

685
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,820
Don't worry about that.

686
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,950
You will know when the time comes.

687
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,350
Waiter! Four bowls of rice noodles.

688
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,390
Coming!

689
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,700
My... My legs are almost broken.

690
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,430
Here are your rice noodles.

691
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,150
Hurry up!

692
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,150
Coming!

693
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:13,750
Hurry up!

694
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,430
Enjoy.

695
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:15,990
Hey! Come here!

696
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,430
Do you need something, sir?

697
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,790
Where are my rice noodles?

698
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,230
Those military gentlemen was here first.

699
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,990
I'm cooking yours now. Doing it now.

700
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:22,750
Hold on.

701
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,110
This is even more delicious than the noodles in Guangzhou.

702
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,340
Well, I see this restaurant

703
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,630
feeds pigs first.

704
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,390
What did you say?

705
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,750
I didn't know pigs could understand human language.

706
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,820
I dare you to say that again!

707
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,420
I said you are pigs.

708
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:39,270
Who are pigs?

709
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,830
Zhao Fusheng pays his respects to his superior.

710
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,830
Who is the pig?

711
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,670
I am, sir.

712
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,870
A vice battalion commander

713
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,190
can be so hard on his comrades' troops.

714
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,030
If they were civilians

715
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,430
I bet you'd eat them alive, huh?

716
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,420
Sir, I wouldn't dare, sir.

717
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,550
I'm teaching you a lesson on behalf of Commander He.

718
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,950
If you were my soldier

719
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,710
I would parade you through the streets!

720
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,350
Lesson learned. Thank you, Commander.

721
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,300
Please take care on the road, Commander Ye!

722
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,790
Here are your rice noodles!

723
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,790
Chen Feng!

724
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,540
I have seen it all.

725
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,630
I apologize, I made a scene.

726
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,230
Well, I thought you guys were having a good time in Wuhan.

727
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,030
Why did you come to Nanchang?

728
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:34,990
I have no idea!

729
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,590
Now Commander He looks like he's possessed

730
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,110
and insisted on coming to Jiangxi with that Cantonese guy.

731
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,270
Now all the high posts in the army have been taken by the Cantonese

732
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,190
and we, the veterans who risked our lives,

733
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,270
are no longer popular.

734
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,630
That bearded He is just a western Hu'nan bandit

735
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,380
and is not like us.

736
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,230
Let me be frank with you.

737
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,270
He Long is singing Xipi with those scholars all day long.

738
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,390
Sing Xipi?

739
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,180
I don't know what it means either.

740
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,150
Even the Cooking Corps has asked about it.

741
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,590
CCP.

742
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,230
What is CCP then?

743
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,310
Chinese Communist Party.

744
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,190
Zhao Fusheng,

745
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,510
you must follow the right people in society these days.

746
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:14,780
How about this...

747
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,390
Will you follow me?

748
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,270
I can at least make you vice commander of a regiment.

749
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,580
Besides, we have

750
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,310
a special fund every month.

751
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,830
Our Jiangxi rice noodles are really good.

752
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,670
Try some.

753
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,060
I'll see you later, Chen Feng.

754
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,990
Everyone, there are 6,000 enemy troops garrisoned in Nanchang City.

755
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,750
They are set up mainly at the 5th Army Headquarters' rear office

756
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,510
in the Financial Commissioner's building.

757
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,200
The 23rd regiment of the KMT 3rd Army in the Examination Hall,

758
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,390
and the 24th regiment of KMT 3rd Army is at the New Camp Gate.

759
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,710
The enemy's main position occupies the area

760
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,630
from the main street to the Financial Commissioner's Building.

761
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,270
Commander He Long,

762
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,830
this is yours to take.

763
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,060
The artillery is ready to offer support at any time.

764
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,430
The gate tower,

765
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,270
with it's commanding height over Nanchang City,

766
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,430
is extremely important.

767
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,430
Ye Ting, your troops are charged with taking it.

768
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,510
Come on guys, all of you.

769
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,350
Come and take a picture!

770
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,940
We're about to start a fight

771
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,750
and it will be a tough one.

772
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,310
There are not many guards in the railway station

773
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,860
and it must be taken as soon as we begin,

774
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,150
in order to cut off their retreat.

775
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,270
Let me stress this last point:

776
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,510
He Long's men must take the Financial Commissioner's Building before dawn!

777
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:15,990
No problem!

778
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,750
Everyone wear a red scarve around your collar

779
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,020
and tie a white towel to your right arm.

780
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,390
A red cross should be placed

781
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,820
on everyone's flashlight lens

782
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,590
to avoid friendly fire

783
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:24,750
in combat at night.

784
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,670
You've thought of everything.

785
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,950
Regiment Commander, an invitation for you from Commander Zhu.

786
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,230
Chen Feng in Nanchang is a serious problem.

787
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,230
He was suspicious of us when we marched into the city.

788
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,750
If Chen wires to Lushan to see what's going on

789
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,230
all of us will be exposed.

790
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,350
As for me,

791
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:00,110
I agree with the uprising.

792
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:02,100
But...

793
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,940
the Comintern has given clear instructions to us

794
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,430
to win over Zhang Fakui.

795
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,190
So I hope you can comply with the wishes of the Central Committee.

796
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,430
So now we have everything ready

797
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,190
and suddenly there is an international influence stepping in

798
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,630
to obstruct the uprising.

799
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:21,590
I object!

800
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,270
I said, comply with the decision of the Central Committee.

801
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,660
Zhang Fakui will arrive in Nanchang on August 1st

802
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,550
and his goal is to come here and wear us down.

803
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,750
The uprising is like an arrow on the bow.

804
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,510
It cannot be stopped!

805
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,500
They keep shifting their commands.

806
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,550
This is Rightist Capitulation!

807
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,030
I think you are a Leftist radical!

808
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,830
To establish a new revolutionary team,

809
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,350
we must be willing to give everything up.

810
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,270
If we miss this chance, we'll regret it forever.

811
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,390
As the General Secretary of the Frontline Committee,

812
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:46,030
I can decide on all matters regarding the Nanchang uprising.

813
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,510
If you make such wild claims,

814
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,950
where does that leave

815
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,110
the Central Committee and the Comintern?

816
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,150
Tie him up!

817
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:56,910
Commander He!

818
00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:58,790
This is a high-level internal meeting.

819
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,990
What are you doing here?

820
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,510
Facing a formidable enemy,

821
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,630
nobody has the right to demoralize the troops!

822
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,710
Nobody!

823
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:11,790
Enlai,

824
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,700
let me ask you this single question:

825
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,390
this uprising,

826
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,670
do we do it or not?

827
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,070
The uprising will not be delayed...

828
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:22,710
Zhou Enlai!

829
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,280
...unless I'm dismissed as General Secretary of the Frontline Committee on the spot.

830
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,070
You!

831
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,230
I don't think things are that complicated.

832
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,230
I have a solution.

833
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,710
Okay, let's hear it.

834
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,540
Take you out.

835
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,710
I'll take care of it.

836
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,230
What are you doing?

837
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,700
I didn't think

838
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,910
that communists would kill one of their own.

839
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,420
Sorry,

840
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,110
I'm not a communist yet.

841
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,230
Now the whole country is in white terror.

842
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,590
If something

843
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,710
happens to Comrade Zhang Guotao,

844
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,750
we won't receive any command.

845
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,750
Any problem for the uprising?

846
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:20,830
Well,

847
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,230
if... I mean if...

848
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,420
According to the Party Constitution,

849
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,070
everyone votes on it.

850
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,430
I have never been to Nanchang.

851
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,790
More than half. It meets the quorum.

852
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,750
The Nanchang Uprising is scheduled for 4a.m.

853
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,270
on August 1.

854
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,260
Marker: three gunshots.

855
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,350
Code word:

856
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,310
"Unifying the Country."

857
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:08,550
I'm back.

858
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,630
Zhao Fusheng, change your equipment.

859
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:11,270
Is there any action?

860
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,030
4a.m.

861
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,150
Dear friends,

862
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,350
cousins

863
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,310
and brothers!

864
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,310
Today we gather in Nanchang

865
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,150
and this place is honored

866
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,790
by your gracious presence!

867
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,270
Everyone, please enjoy your time

868
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,950
and get very, very drunk!

869
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,150
Hurrah!

870
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,110
Before we act,

871
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,030
I have a plan

872
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,230
to invite all the leaders

873
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:00,350
in Nanchang to drink

874
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,670
until they are

875
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:02,750
completely drunk.

876
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,350
This should buy you all some time.

877
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,910
This is the reason you asked for a fund?

878
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,980
Of course.

879
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,350
It costs money to rent a place,

880
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,390
buy alcohol

881
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,030
and find these people.

882
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:21,350
Nobody move!

883
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:22,670
Don't move!

884
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,110
I get first pick.

885
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,710
What are we waiting for? Let's take them.

886
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:30,910
Hey, Chen,

887
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,350
something on your mind?

888
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,190
Chief Zhu,

889
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:34,990
such a spectacle today...

890
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,190
I'm not used to it.

891
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,030
Basically every officer in Nanchang is here.

892
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,870
I'm concerned that if anything happens...

893
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,230
Excuse me.

894
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,190
Report!

895
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,230
Zhao Fusheng, one of our vice battalion commanders,

896
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,030
left and has not returned.

897
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,310
Zhao Fusheng!

898
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:51,710
That menace!

899
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,150
I've lectured him already.

900
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,950
Is it likely that he would leak the information?

901
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:55,870
Better play safe

902
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:56,950
than be sorry.

903
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:57,910
I suggest

904
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,590
we hold an emergency meeting now

905
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,310
and adjust the uprising plan.

906
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,310
Check your markers.

907
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:30,310
Once the fighting starts

908
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,660
we identify the markers only, not the person.

909
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:32,670
Chen Feng!

910
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,230
Fusheng.

911
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,030
Something terrible is happening!

912
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,310
Hurry up!

913
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,830
Everybody, assemble!

914
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,430
Everyone, assume your position

915
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,870
and prepare to fight!

916
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,830
Everyone,

917
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,630
assume your position

918
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,070
and prepare to fight!

919
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:54,750
Understand?

920
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:56,950
Yes, sir!

921
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:05,990
How are the preparations coming?

922
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,190
Two regiments of the 24th Division are ready

923
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,070
and every member is on standby.

924
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,270
The artillery outside the city is ready for battle.

925
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,830
The 20th Army is ready for battle.

926
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,630
I don't know what's happening with Zhu De's troops.

927
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,390
Don't worry.

928
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,110
He doesn't make mistakes.

929
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,110
Brothers!

930
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,030
Take the Financial Commissioner's Building

931
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,150
within the hour!

932
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,110
Yes, sir!

933
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:10,710
Move out!

934
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,430
Fire!

935
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:30,550
Fire!

936
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,590
Report!

937
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,710
Our 20th Army's Training Regiment

938
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,590
has seized the new barracks of the 3rd Army's 79th Regiment.

939
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:57,630
Don't move!

940
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:58,910
Don't move!

941
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,510
Nobody move!

942
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,230
Report!

943
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,590
The guard companies from the Training Regiment and 4th Regiment of the 24th Division

944
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,070
now occupy Niuhang Railway Station.

945
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,350
The Railway Station!

946
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,310
Nothing.

947
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:10,510
Why?

948
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,310
The phone line has been cut.

949
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,230
Report!

950
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,430
Our 72nd Regiment has captured

951
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,590
the 23rd Regiment of KMT's 3rd Army at the Examination Hall.

952
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,590
What's the situation?

953
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,710
Go on! It's nothing!

954
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:48,590
Go!

955
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:53,910
What are you doing?

956
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:37,830
Somebody help! Now! The machine-guns!

957
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,550
Retreat from the gate!

958
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,670
Report! The gate is being shelled!

959
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:55,870
He Long's troops have been discovered on the main street!

960
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:10,750
Attack!

961
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:21,150
Send the 6th Company to reinforce the city gate!

962
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,430
It must be held!

963
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:26,870
I want the Maxim machine-guns on the main street

964
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:27,950
where we make our final stand

965
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,550
against this He Long!

966
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:30,990
Save him!

967
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,670
Take a flour bag.

968
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,190
Provide cover fire!

969
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,510
Charge!

970
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:24,590
Follow!

971
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,110
Follow me to the gate!

972
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:27,910
Hurry up! Get everything!

973
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:30,950
Don't move! Nobody move!

974
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:32,950
Put down what's in your hands!

975
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,870
Put it down! Put everything down!

976
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,950
Don't move! Put your hands up!

977
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,070
Don't move! Drop it!

978
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:40,980
Don't move!

979
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,150
Take the hard cash first!

980
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,230
We're facing a revolution

981
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,150
and this money

982
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,230
is temporarily requisitioned.

983
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:47,950
It will be returned

984
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:49,230
when the war is over.

985
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:50,030
Understand?

986
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:53,660
We are writing you a receipt.

987
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,430
Quick!

988
01:01:59,000 --> 01:01:59,590
Take it!

989
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:01,910
Go!

990
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,430
Go with several men, sneak out of the city

991
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,070
and ask for reinforcements!

992
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,390
Feng, one more thing.

993
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:11,710
Remember.

994
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:12,910
They wear red scarves on their collars

995
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,300
and white towels on their arms.

996
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,350
Don't move! Don't move!

997
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,070
Put the gun down!

998
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,620
Don't move! Identify yourself!

999
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:26,110
Don't move!

1000
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,150
Don't shoot!

1001
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:32,630
Password!

1002
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,750
We're friends!

1003
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,350
Remember, everyone has a red scarf on their collar

1004
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:37,660
and a white towel tied to their right arm.

1005
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,670
Why are you crying?

1006
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,350
Go!

1007
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,180
We met resistance at the gate. Requesting support!

1008
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,830
How is the 20th Army doing on the main street?

1009
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:08,950
It's a stalemate.

1010
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:09,870
I'm going!

1011
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,030
Let's move!

1012
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,790
Commander! Commander!

1013
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:22,670
He Long's troops are about to break through our defenses

1014
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:23,830
and we can't hold much longer!

1015
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:41,830
Outflank them!

1016
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:57,070
Take cover!

1017
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:58,910
Take cover!

1018
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:26,590
Report!

1019
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:27,910
He Long's troops have taken the clock tower

1020
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,070
but face strong resistance at the Financial Commissioner's Building.

1021
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:35,590
Fire!

1022
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:50,950
Firing positions!

1023
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,790
Retreat!

1024
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,830
Report! We are unable take Deshengmen Gate

1025
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:22,900
and our casualties are so heavy

1026
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,750
that we are forced to retreat. Request reinforcements!

1027
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:35,510
Stop crying!

1028
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,750
Get me bandages now!

1029
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:39,870
Give them to me now!

1030
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:41,670
Stay with me!

1031
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:43,150
Hold on!

1032
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,300
Come help me, now!

1033
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,150
Mortar!

1034
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,350
Mortar!

1035
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,870
Distance 370...

1036
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:07,630
Fire!

1037
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:50,830
Report!

1038
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,060
Ye Ting commands reinforcement troops

1039
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,510
to begin shelling Deshengmen Gate!

1040
01:06:59,160 --> 01:06:59,990
Get ready!

1041
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,420
Don't stop! Drop everything you've got on them!

1042
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:31,230
Fire!

1043
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,870
Su Yu! Attack!

1044
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,260
Get ready!

1045
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:54,990
Go!

1046
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,070
Retreat!

1047
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:07,190
Grenade!

1048
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,270
Get ready!

1049
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:20,670
Fire!

1050
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:42,870
Don't move!

1051
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:46,830
Don't move!

1052
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:47,670
Put the gun down!

1053
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,230
Take them away!

1054
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:03,310
Report!

1055
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,230
The battle has ended!

1056
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,390
Our troops have captured the Financial Commissioner's Building

1057
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:08,430
and occupy Deshengmen Gate!

1058
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,820
Don't move!

1059
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:49,150
Stay down!

1060
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:50,430
Don't move!

1061
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,430
Take this!

1062
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:18,750
Stay close to me!

1063
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:19,950
Follow me!

1064
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:25,390
Put down your gun!

1065
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,830
Put the gun down!

1066
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:33,430
Commander!

1067
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,510
We have won!

1068
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:15,150
Victory!

1069
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:29,070
Brother, why are you so late?

1070
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:29,710
The battle is over!

1071
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:30,430
A Mosin-Nagant.

1072
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:31,550
I saved this for you.

1073
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:33,430
Don't be too cocky.

1074
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:34,780
Later, I will return to you a new one.

1075
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:35,710
Don't forget you said that.

1076
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,590
Victory!

1077
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:11,110
Soong Ching-ling, Tan Pingshan, Liu Yazi and Mao Zedong

1078
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:13,310
have composed a Declaration of Members of the Central Committee.

1079
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,350
What does it say?

1080
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:15,750
One:

1081
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,350
Oppose the directives and resolutions issued in the name

1082
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,670
of the Central Party Bureau by a few members of the Central Committee in Wuhan.

1083
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:22,430
Two:

1084
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:23,670
Uphold the Three Principles of the People for building a society

1085
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,750
of the people, by the people and for the people

1086
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:26,590
and support the Three Great Policies of

1087
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:29,590
allying with Russia and the Communist Party, and assisting the workers and peasants.

1088
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:31,870
Three:

1089
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,630
Work hard to build a new base area,

1090
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,750
so as to convene the Third National Congress

1091
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:38,990
outside the spheres of the old and new warlords, to discuss

1092
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:40,910
the question of concentrating the revolutionary forces

1093
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:43,110
and continuing the revolutionary work.

1094
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:46,310
I really don't understand

1095
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,310
why Mrs. Sun is involved with the communists.

1096
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:50,310
Seven:

1097
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,660
Actively prepare our forces

1098
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:54,110
to wipe out new-style warlords like Chiang, Feng Yuxiang and Tang Shengzhi,

1099
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:55,870
who represent the forces of all the imperialists,

1100
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:58,260
the northern warlords, and feudal society within the country.

1101
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:01,390
To wipe out Chiang, Feng Yuxiang and Tang Shengzhi.

1102
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,220
I am the top of the list.

1103
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,380
I guess this means

1104
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,430
things between us are irreconcilable.

1105
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:11,430
Commander-in-Chief,

1106
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,430
Li Jishen wired us from Guangzhou to ask

1107
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,430
what should be done about the rebellion in Nanchang.

1108
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,580
Let them decide on their own.

1109
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:22,750
Jishi,

1110
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,310
south of the Yangtze receives little rain in late summer.

1111
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,030
The newly planted plane trees in Nanjing

1112
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:29,150
should be watered well.

1113
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,910
Miss Mei-ling asked about this yesterday.

1114
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:33,510
Yes, sir. I will keep that in mind.

1115
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:39,310
Both Zhou Enlai and Mao Zedong are people with ideals.

1116
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,110
They both have a desire

1117
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,550
to transform China.

1118
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,430
But this is in opposition to Chiang's interests.

1119
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:49,780
I think Chiang

1120
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:52,830
used us to have Li Dazhao killed.

1121
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:54,780
The communists

1122
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,230
will surely remember what we have done.

1123
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:00,990
But in this world of ours

1124
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,390
there is no cure for regret.

1125
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:05,870
Attention!

1126
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:06,910
Come,

1127
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:07,630
Salute!

1128
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:08,150
Come, come!

1129
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,300
We've seized 5,000 rifles,

1130
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:11,870
700,000 rounds

1131
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:12,990
and captured 3,000 men.

1132
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,830
This was a brilliant victory.

1133
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:16,750
Zhang Fakui and Zhu Peide's troops

1134
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,350
are marching to Nanchang.

1135
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:20,190
Li Jishen sent Qian Dajun

1136
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,830
and his troops from Guangzhou.

1137
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,300
Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek's armies are forming an alliance

1138
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,230
and a huge net has now been cast.

1139
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:27,630
Nanchang,

1140
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,150
we can't hold any longer.

1141
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:34,430
Then we should quickly sweep the battlefield and lead our men south,

1142
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,710
take the Chaozhou-Shantou region, and make use of their docks

1143
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:39,380
to gain access to the goods and arms support from the Comintern.

1144
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:41,830
We fight all the way to Guangzhou, gather our strength,

1145
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,630
and prepare for the second Northern Expedition

1146
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:45,310
to unite the whole China!

1147
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,110
Enlai!

1148
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,220
Nie Rongzhen, you are such a bad ass!

1149
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:54,290
You have even delivered to me

1150
01:14:54,310 --> 01:14:55,590
Wang Jingwei's reserve force!

1151
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:57,310
Your service is commendable!

1152
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,960
From now on, the 25th Division is ours and will fight for us.

1153
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:05,180
My only regret is

1154
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:06,500
I failed to catch the uprising.

1155
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,030
Nanchang is only the starting point.

1156
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:09,750
Everything has just begun.

1157
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:39,270
The Comintern considers

1158
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,950
Mikhail Borodin and Chen Duxiu's errors to be serious.

1159
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,230
They have brought disastrous consequences to China's revolutionary situation.

1160
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,310
The suspension of Chen's position as general secretary

1161
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:55,740
is both the decision of the Comintern

1162
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:57,830
and the unanimous request from China's Party's comrades.

1163
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,780
In the absence of Chen,

1164
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,720
Comrades Qu Qiubai and Li Weihan will be in charge of the Central Committee's work.

1165
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,110
A tall figure with long hair.

1166
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,150
You must be Mao Zedong?

1167
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,110
Big head and small figure...

1168
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,070
I assume you are...

1169
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,750
Deng Xixian. I just changed my name.

1170
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,190
I am Deng Xiaoping now.

1171
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,870
Clearly you are highly skilled to have escaped

1172
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:27,910
from He'nan's white terror.

1173
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:29,670
It was a narrow escape. I'll tell you all about it later

1174
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,030
and I promise my story will astonish you.

1175
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:32,030
Quick, get in there.

1176
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:32,990
A big quarrel is going on inside.

1177
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:34,710
China is not Turkey.

1178
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,790
Since Chiang wants to be Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in China

1179
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:38,910
we are left with no choice

1180
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:40,030
but to firmly take him down.

1181
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:41,270
To fight against Cheng Kai-shek

1182
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,510
we must first solve the problems within the party.

1183
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:44,630
The theme of today's meeting

1184
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:47,620
is to criticize Chen Duxiu's right-wing capitulation errors,

1185
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:49,420
correct the Party's working direction,

1186
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:51,590
and deal with the current situation to turn the tide.

1187
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:52,910
We see setbacks as a starting point.

1188
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,780
We start over from the very beginning.

1189
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,430
Enlai and others lead troops south to Guangzhou

1190
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:58,230
to prepare to rebuild the revolutionary base,

1191
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:00,630
to get rid of those two-faced careerists,

1192
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:01,550
and to launch a new Northern Expedition.

1193
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:02,190
This revolution

1194
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:04,790
is not about the KMT alone.

1195
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:06,580
It is also about communists,

1196
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:07,910
workers, peasants and the masses.

1197
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,590
Exactly. A revolution for the masses, for workers and peasants.

1198
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:10,750
You are not a formal representative.

1199
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:11,590
It is not your place to speak.

1200
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:14,790
The Comintern decision is good

1201
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,590
but the people they sent here are problematic.

1202
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,510
What either Borodin or Manabendra Nath Roy does

1203
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:19,820
is wishful thinking.

1204
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,960
Chen Duxiu's mistake is overestimating the KMT.

1205
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:25,350
Thus the Communist Party becomes not the host of the revolution

1206
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,580
but merely a guest.

1207
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,430
This causes us to lose all initiative.

1208
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,670
If not for the military campaign by Enlai and others,

1209
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,620
we would not even have the strength to fight back

1210
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,350
when they turn their backs on us.

1211
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,580
The April 12th Massacre

1212
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:39,300
taught us a lesson:

1213
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,750
political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.

1214
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,190
Great! Well said!

1215
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,390
Zedong,Zedong!

1216
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:53,500
You are a party member with seniority

1217
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,270
and your organizational skill can convince the masses.

1218
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,310
We all hope you can go to Shanghai.

1219
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:58,540
I'm just a country boy

1220
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:00,270
and I'm not used to the city's tall buildings.

1221
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:01,820
I plan to go back to Hu'nan.

1222
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:02,910
Once the harvest comes,

1223
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:04,990
I will get some guns on the border of Hu'nan and Jiangxi

1224
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:05,950
and do something big.

1225
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:06,790
Can you even go back?

1226
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,630
The enemies in Changsha offer a handsome reward for your head

1227
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,350
and the landlords would happily watch you be burned alive.

1228
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:15,830
Since the very first day I joined the Party

1229
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,710
I have been making every preparation.

1230
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:19,870
Every day people are murdered there.

1231
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,510
Even Heaven is shedding tears.

1232
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,550
Let it cry. I will do my work.

1233
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,190
He who has seen ghosts does not fear darkness,

1234
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:28,980
because he knows well in his heart

1235
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:30,790
that this is darkness before dawn.

1236
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:32,310
I am the Party's General Secretary.

1237
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,110
Listen to me and go to Shanghai.

1238
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,070
Give it a second thought.

1239
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:36,150
The Central Committee needs you.

1240
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:45,310
Thank you all.

1241
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,150
I'm not a communist!

1242
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:42,270
Kaihui,

1243
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:45,520
I think you should take our son and return to Shaoshan.

1244
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:46,830
No.

1245
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:48,910
Nowhere is safe.

1246
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,750
More and more are killed every day.

1247
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,070
Do you still remember

1248
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:55,750
at Peking University,

1249
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,990
when you carried me on your shoulders to watch the fireworks?

1250
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:05,670
I do.

1251
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,220
It is my dream that someday

1252
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:22,990
I will watch them with you once again.

1253
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,150
But once I leave,

1254
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,020
we won't know

1255
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:28,430
when we will meet again.

1256
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:31,830
I'll be waiting for you.

1257
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:34,140
If you don't return after half a year,

1258
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:35,700
I will wait a year.

1259
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:37,390
If not after a year,

1260
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:38,700
I will wait ten years.

1261
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,220
If not after ten years,

1262
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:41,820
I will wait a lifetime.

1263
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:13,750
Please just don't say anything.

1264
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,230
Dad!

1265
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:27,700
Don't look back.

1266
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:30,670
Go!

1267
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:33,910
Dad!

1268
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,230
Dad!

1269
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,150
Dad!

1270
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,260
Dad!

1271
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,870
Dad!

1272
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:27,750
Mr. Wang,

1273
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:29,710
in the early morning,

1274
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,430
the communists led rebel troops

1275
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,230
and launched a fierce attack

1276
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:34,510
on Qian Dajun's troops in Huichang.

1277
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:35,710
The fighting was fierce.

1278
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,190
Kill!

1279
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:43,910
At 4p.m.

1280
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:44,910
the rebel troops

1281
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,510
occupied Huichang City.

1282
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:48,270
The lower rank officers on both sides

1283
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:49,710
are mostly Huangpu students.

1284
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:52,190
They have the hearts to kill each other?

1285
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:56,150
Charge!

1286
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:01,030
In the end,

1287
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:02,830
they engaged in hand-to-hand combat.

1288
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:03,950
That's preposterous!

1289
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:05,620
What about Qian Dajun?

1290
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:12,110
He broke out,

1291
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,390
but lost 5,000 troops.

1292
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:18,230
These troops are under the direct control of Chiang's 1st Army.

1293
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,510
Qian Dajun will not let that go.

1294
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:22,780
When shephards quarrel,

1295
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:23,750
the wolf has a winning game.

1296
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:25,350
Ye Ting and Zhou Yiqun's

1297
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,870
3rd Division of the 20th Army also suffered heavy causalities.

1298
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,630
Cai Tingkai's 10th Division

1299
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,950
defected on the battlefield

1300
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:31,830
and left the Communist Party.

1301
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:34,700
Cai Tingkai's defection

1302
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,190
is a stunning blow to our troops' morale.

1303
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,910
Rumors are spreading like wildfire.

1304
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:39,790
Someone said

1305
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,110
the ship was sinking.

1306
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:42,430
Jump first and you survive.

1307
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:43,350
Jump later and you die.

1308
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,310
Cai Tingkai's such a bastard.

1309
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,580
That bastard is gone

1310
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:47,900
and I, Chen Yi, am here.

1311
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:48,990
I started from Wuhan

1312
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:49,990
and I kept running to catch up with you.

1313
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,070
Finally,

1314
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:52,700
I caught up with you in Huichang.

1315
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:54,830
Mr. Zhou!

1316
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:58,670
Commander He, what happened?

1317
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,550
This is my application for admission to the Party.

1318
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,190
Please grant me my wish!

1319
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:10,630
I, He Long,

1320
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:11,510
will follow the Communist Party

1321
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:12,750
till my last breath!

1322
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:48,950
Hurry!

1323
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:51,350
Watch this red devil for me!

1324
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:53,150
If he gets away, you'll be finished!

1325
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:54,550
I'm going to the toilet.

1326
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:56,430
Get going!

1327
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:58,590
Were you rewarded

1328
01:24:58,920 --> 01:24:59,790
for my capture?

1329
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:00,990
Rewarded?

1330
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:02,750
The money is not even enough for the officials to distribute.

1331
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:04,710
How could there be any left for someone as low as me?

1332
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:10,550
Feel right here.

1333
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:13,710
Down.

1334
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,670
Take it out and have a look.

1335
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:19,110
Three for each of you.

1336
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:20,430
No more left.

1337
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:35,430
The red devil escaped!

1338
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,710
The red devil escaped!

1339
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,190
Don't move!

1340
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:14,990
This guy is really weird.

1341
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:15,980
He doesn't say anything.

1342
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:16,910
All he does is eat.

1343
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:18,150
Please don't talk like that.

1344
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,910
You captured me and took me here for no reason.

1345
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:20,950
And I don't have a choice.

1346
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:22,100
A big guy's gotta eat more.

1347
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:27,870
Who are you?

1348
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,230
Who are you?

1349
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:31,230
National Revolutionary Army

1350
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:32,510
2nd Army

1351
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:33,590
Regiment Guard Commander

1352
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:34,590
Lu Deming.

1353
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:38,740
You can ask Mr. Luo.

1354
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:40,430
Commander Lu,

1355
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:41,820
this is the Central Commissioner,

1356
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:42,910
Comrade Mao Zedong.

1357
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:44,590
Comrade Mao Zedong!

1358
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:46,750
I'm terribly sorry.

1359
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:48,030
No need for that.

1360
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:48,950
No need to apologize.

1361
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:50,870
If you could give me some steamed radish

1362
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:51,830
that would be enough.

1363
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:52,750
Sure.

1364
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:54,710
After we have taken Changsha,

1365
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:56,710
there will be plenty of red stewed pork for you.

1366
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:00,300
You want to attack Changsha?

1367
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:01,790
Yes,

1368
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,100
an echo of the Nanchang Uprising

1369
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:04,870
and another heavy blow to those bastards.

1370
01:27:05,080 --> 01:27:06,350
To join the uprising movement,

1371
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,590
Commander Lu used Zhang Fakui's transfer order

1372
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:10,670
to lead 2,000 Regiment Guards to Nanchang.

1373
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,100
But by the time we reached Fengxin County,

1374
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:13,790
all the troops had withdrawn from Nanchang.

1375
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:15,390
So I decided to

1376
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:17,070
conserve our strength and rest here.

1377
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:18,230
And as a result,

1378
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:19,590
you were captured.

1379
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:21,340
We must change our unit designations now.

1380
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,430
Change our designations?

1381
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:24,510
Yes and we must make entirely new flags.

1382
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:26,510
No more blue sky, white sun, and red earth?

1383
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:28,270
This Nationalist flag

1384
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:29,340
can't be used anymore.

1385
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:30,670
But we held up this flag

1386
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,110
and fought under this flag during the Uprising.

1387
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:48,990
The orphan next door is crying.

1388
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,390
Warlords,

1389
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,110
landlords, and capitalists

1390
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:57,270
hate the workers' and peasants' armed movement.

1391
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:58,990
They've been ordered by the Nationalists

1392
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:00,340
to embark on a consolidation campaign.

1393
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:01,550
From cities like Wuhan and Shanghai

1394
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:03,020
to towns and villages,

1395
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:05,190
you find everywhere their victims, wailing in despair.

1396
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,150
Even Chongyang and Tongcheng Counties

1397
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,500
have been completely decimated.

1398
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:11,070
10% of those who joined the peasants' movement

1399
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,220
have been executed.

1400
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:14,790
With such atrocities,

1401
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:17,070
how could the people still trust the government?

1402
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:17,950
With such atrocities,

1403
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:19,430
how could we continue to use

1404
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:21,950
this flag and these symbols?

1405
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:23,270
All right.

1406
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,310
How should we rank the troops?

1407
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:42,350
Let us use

1408
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:46,590
1st Division, 1st Army of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Army!

1409
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:38,430
Our troops have entered the boundary of Jieyang

1410
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,430
and will reach the Chaozhou-Shantou region next.

1411
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,030
But they face enemy troops from Guangdong and Guangxi in front.

1412
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:46,150
Qian Dajun is right on their ass.

1413
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:48,910
This dog skin plaster is so tightly attached

1414
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:49,990
that you can't even shake it off.

1415
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:51,910
To win in the Chaozhou-Shantou region,

1416
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,350
we must first eliminate Qian Dajun.

1417
01:29:58,120 --> 01:29:59,260
I'll set an ambush for them.

1418
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:01,140
We have a shortage of troops

1419
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:02,830
which makes it impossible for us

1420
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:04,070
to divide our forces.

1421
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,350
I'm afraid peeling off this plaster with sheer force

1422
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,270
might also take off a layer of skin.

1423
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,670
I'll be in charge of holding Sanheba district.

1424
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:18,550
They have 30,000 men.

1425
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:23,350
How many soldiers can you give us?

1426
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:25,870
3,000.00

1427
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:29,830
And how many days will you need?

1428
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:31,670
3

1429
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:36,150
After 3 days

1430
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,950
I will lead the combat force to meet you

1431
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:39,870
and together we will fight our way to Guangzhou.

1432
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:49,980
As long as I am alive,

1433
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,230
Qian Dajun will not cross Sanheba District!

1434
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:16,380
I have this one single question for you all.

1435
01:31:17,240 --> 01:31:18,300
Did participating in the Autumn Harvest Uprising

1436
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:20,190
cause you a great deal of suffering?

1437
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:25,900
Will any of you answer my question?

1438
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,510
If nobody will answer my question,

1439
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,070
I'll take it that none of you suffered.

1440
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:34,150
Right?

1441
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:37,630
If you don't speak up now,

1442
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,310
there won't be another chance.

1443
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:40,750
No crying about your suffering.

1444
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:42,030
You hear me or not?

1445
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:44,910
Commander Lu has made the stakes very clear.

1446
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:46,590
In that case, right now we will set a few basic rules.

1447
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,550
From now on, whether marching or fighting,

1448
01:31:48,720 --> 01:31:49,940
eating or sleeping out in the open air,

1449
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:51,780
you shall not whine about your suffering.

1450
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:54,550
Let me ask you again.

1451
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:55,990
Will you suffer?

1452
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:57,230
Yes!

1453
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:58,710
Everyone, answer me together!

1454
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,110
Will you suffer?

1455
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:01,230
Yes!

1456
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:02,590
Louder!

1457
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:05,590
Yes!

1458
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:15,550
We need to move soon.

1459
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:23,300
Go! Move!

1460
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:28,990
Take cover!

1461
01:32:29,160 --> 01:32:29,790
Hurry up!

1462
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:33,350
Save the injured!

1463
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:34,710
Save the injured!

1464
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:35,630
Hurry up!

1465
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:39,940
Retreat! Go!

1466
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:40,590
Move!

1467
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:43,380
Move!

1468
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:46,190
Retreat! Go!

1469
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:11,230
Comrade Lu sacrificed himself to give us cover.

1470
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:15,750
He exchanged his life for our bloody lesson:

1471
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:26,070
Large cities can't be attacked

1472
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:28,350
and progressive ideology will not be tolerated.

1473
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:31,790
Now we have only one path ahead of us.

1474
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:34,870
We continue to march to Jinggangshan

1475
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:36,660
to be kings of the mountain.

1476
01:34:24,240 --> 01:34:27,030
Use the grass dug up as camouflage.

1477
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:30,230
Trenches should be dug in a V or a U shape.

1478
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:32,510
Trenches should also be dug in the lowest area

1479
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:34,670
to reduce injuries from shrapnel and to drain.

1480
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,030
Remember, set up elbow platforms

1481
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:38,550
so that while firing at the enemy

1482
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:40,860
the maximum amount of energy can be saved.

1483
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:07,510
Three rivers converge at Sanheba.

1484
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:12,830
Qian Dajun is stationed on the west bank.

1485
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:18,870
To fight us he must cross the Ting River

1486
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:20,020
and he will land somewhere around here.

1487
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:21,350
Now I will assign to each of you your missions.

1488
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:22,710
Battalion Commander Li,

1489
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,790
you set up a defense along the Shizi'an bank

1490
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:26,310
and quietly wait for a chance to ambush.

1491
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,270
Cai Qingchuan, Lin Biao and Chen Yi,

1492
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:36,150
you ambush near Shizidong and Longhukeng.

1493
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,430
We are short on ammunition, therefore,

1494
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:40,110
no gunshots without my command.

1495
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:40,950
Yes, sir!

1496
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:55,150
Comrades, we are facing a tough battle.

1497
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:57,990
Qian Dajun has 30,000 troops.

1498
01:35:58,020 --> 01:35:59,830
We've less than 3,000

1499
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:00,950
and no reinforcements.

1500
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:03,790
So I simply ask one thing from all of you:

1501
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:07,230
no unnecessary sacrifice.

1502
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:20,550
Jinggangshan has 5 wells.

1503
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:22,870
This is the best place for the Worker-Peasant Rev. Army!

1504
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:26,100
Over the past few months

1505
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:29,150
so many communist heads have rolled.

1506
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,030
But all of us here are survivors.

1507
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:33,590
What is a survivor?

1508
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:34,790
A survivor is someone

1509
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,390
who lives the life of the dead

1510
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:39,510
so that they did not die in vain,

1511
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,710
but instead made a valuable sacrifice.

1512
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:44,430
I hear Ye Ting's Independent Regiment built a Party branch

1513
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:45,830
which plays the role of a fort for the Communists

1514
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:47,060
that can't be worn down or destroyed.

1515
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,550
This has made them a very capable force.

1516
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,710
I think

1517
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:52,700
even the regimental level is not enough.

1518
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:53,870
This should be done on the company level.

1519
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:55,620
Establish a Party representative system,

1520
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,300
to have a Party group in a platoon,

1521
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:58,590
Party members in a squad,

1522
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:01,070
and the principle that the Party commands the gun will be implemented.

1523
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,070
This point

1524
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:03,670
I will report to the Central Committee in advance.

1525
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:05,100
How can there be enough Party members?

1526
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:06,750
Recruitment is happening now.

1527
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,140
Those not afraid of death or not taken by greed,

1528
01:37:08,160 --> 01:37:09,590
and are capable of fighting for the poor,

1529
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:10,870
they can be Party members.

1530
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:33,110
Their line of defense stretches over 5 km on the opposite bank.

1531
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:35,510
And we don't yet know where their vulnerabilities lie.

1532
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:37,030
The artillery regiment is ready

1533
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:39,030
and can bombard the opposite bank at anytime.

1534
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:43,790
Have the enemy troops been located?

1535
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:47,710
Send the 4th Regiment to cross the river

1536
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:49,420
and carry out a search.

1537
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:59,270
Report! Enemy has begun their attack!

1538
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,510
Report! Enemy has reached the bank along Shizian

1539
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:51,310
and the initial estimate is 2,000 men!

1540
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:54,230
Wait.

1541
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:13,070
Report! Enemy vanguard has landed at Shizian!

1542
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:26,350
I order you to attack!

1543
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:30,190
Lin Biao! Chen Yi!

1544
01:40:30,320 --> 01:40:30,750
Attack!

1545
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,830
Our beach landing has met fierce resistance

1546
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:48,900
and casualties are heavy!

1547
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:01,780
Fire at the enemy defense line!

1548
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:03,180
But the 4th Regiment is still engaged with the enemy!

1549
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:06,230
Sometimes you gotta make a few sacrifices.

1550
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:07,070
Fire!

1551
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:11,140
Distance 175, to the right 003,

1552
01:41:11,160 --> 01:41:11,910
Get ready!

1553
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:12,790
Fire!

1554
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:20,710
Retreat!

1555
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:40,980
Take cover!

1556
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:42,830
Take cover now!

1557
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:44,990
Take cover!

1558
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:48,950
Get ready!

1559
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:49,790
Fire!

1560
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,310
Hurry!

1561
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:33,350
Into the trench!

1562
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:34,710
Hurry!

1563
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:36,100
Now!

1564
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:37,100
Into the trench!

1565
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:42,740
Go!

1566
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:46,910
Fire!

1567
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:55,750
Everybody hide in the craters!

1568
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:11,030
Why did we stop?

1569
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:12,630
Keep firing! Now!

1570
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:13,990
Report, Commander,

1571
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:14,710
we've run out of shells.

1572
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:15,750
What do you mean you're out?

1573
01:43:16,240 --> 01:43:17,430
We had a logistical problem,

1574
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:18,670
more shells will arrive in 2 days.

1575
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:52,910
Hurry! Save them!

1576
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:12,510
Mom, I miss home!

1577
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:23,110
I want to go home!

1578
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:25,870
I don't want to die.

1579
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:33,630
Mom, I'm so scared!

1580
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:13,030
The battle raged the entire day

1581
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,790
and we consumed a large amount of munitions.

1582
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:16,630
All the soldiers in 3rd Company are dead.

1583
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:18,270
Facing the enemy's attack tomorrow,

1584
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:20,630
I don't know if we will be able to hold.

1585
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:44,830
Here, collect the munitions!

1586
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:45,750
And those too!

1587
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,350
Go! Retreat!

1588
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:08,190
Report! 1st Army has landed at Shizian and is in pursuit.

1589
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:09,230
They will drive straight to Longhukeng!

1590
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:16,710
You're in charge here.

1591
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:17,270
Go!

1592
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:36,110
Fire!

1593
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,550
Report! 1st Regiment was ambushed at Longhukeng!

1594
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:47,490
Report!

1595
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:49,390
3rd Regiment has reached east bank

1596
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:50,580
and is driving straight to main position!

1597
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:51,980
2nd Regiment has begun their offensive!

1598
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:05,230
Attack!

1599
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,060
Grenade!

1600
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:22,940
The machine-gun is silent! The machine-gun!

1601
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:24,030
I'll go!

1602
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:50,910
Grenade!

1603
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:12,590
Gather all the weapons and munitions,

1604
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:14,590
disarm the captives and take them away!

1605
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:15,710
Yes, sir!

1606
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:18,870
Hurry! Another assault is coming! Move!

1607
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:24,750
Pick up the ammo!

1608
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:26,510
Save the injured! Hurry!

1609
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:39,550
Now we are down to less than two thousand men

1610
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:42,830
and all the ambush positions have been exposed.

1611
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:44,990
There is still one more day to hold.

1612
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:47,630
What the hell should I do?

1613
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:50,630
Nobody!

1614
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:15,430
Commander Qian,

1615
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:17,230
is it okay? How about this?

1616
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:29,670
Comrades,

1617
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:32,150
we have been fighting alone these past few days.

1618
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:33,950
Many of our brothers have been sacrificed.

1619
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:35,950
Facing our fallen brothers today

1620
01:50:36,120 --> 01:50:38,310
I, Zhu De, am filled with guilt.

1621
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:41,590
However,

1622
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:44,340
the precious time bought with our lives

1623
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:47,710
grants the surviving opportunities for our main force.

1624
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:48,630
Tell me,

1625
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:49,670
is it worth it or not?

1626
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:52,270
Yes!

1627
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:54,030
The blocking mission is complete

1628
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:55,710
and we are retreating from Sanheba.

1629
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:58,270
On the opposite bank, Qian Dajun

1630
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:00,350
is not going to let us out of here easily.

1631
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:02,740
So I have decided

1632
01:51:02,760 --> 01:51:04,350
that 200 men will stay behind

1633
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:06,350
to make our final stand against Qian Dajun

1634
01:51:06,360 --> 01:51:08,590
to help more people get out alive.

1635
01:51:09,240 --> 01:51:12,710
There is little hope for survival for those that stay.

1636
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:14,070
Therefore,

1637
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:15,910
if both father and son serve in the army,

1638
01:51:16,240 --> 01:51:18,310
the son leaves with the rest of the team.

1639
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:19,740
If both older and younger brothers serve in the army,

1640
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:20,990
the older brother stays.

1641
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:24,110
Everyone, remember. The revolutionary road is long

1642
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:27,670
and we are here to leave seeds for China's revolution.

1643
01:51:31,600 --> 01:51:33,630
I am the 11th Army, 25th Division, 73rd Regiment,

1644
01:51:34,080 --> 01:51:35,790
3rd Battalion Commander, Cai Qingchuan.

1645
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:36,830
I request to stay.

1646
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:39,220
11th Army, 24th Division, 72nd Regiment Commander,

1647
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:40,110
Sun Shucheng,

1648
01:51:40,120 --> 01:51:41,750
is willing to stay and make a final stand.

1649
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:43,350
Chen Yi, political director,

1650
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:44,950
will stay and fight!

1651
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:45,910
Report!

1652
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:46,910
I am an orphan

1653
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:48,550
and I am willing to stay!

1654
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:51,120
I will stay!

1655
01:51:52,440 --> 01:51:53,150
I want to stay!

1656
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:54,110
I should stay!

1657
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:54,750
Brother!

1658
01:51:55,040 --> 01:51:55,670
I will stay!

1659
01:51:55,680 --> 01:51:56,350
Sit down!

1660
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:02,630
We will all stay and fight!

1661
01:52:03,080 --> 01:52:03,590
Go back!

1662
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:04,710
Listen to me,

1663
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:06,630
you must preserve your lives!

1664
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:08,510
The revolutionary needs you.

1665
01:52:09,120 --> 01:52:10,750
You are the hope for a new China!

1666
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:11,990
Understand?

1667
01:52:39,720 --> 01:52:40,670
Be a warrior

1668
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:42,510
but not a martyr!

1669
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:44,270
Return alive!

1670
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:45,620
Yes, sir!

1671
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:54,950
Salute!

1672
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:49,030
Send my order. Capture Sanheba within one hour!

1673
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:54,790
Comrades, we have only one mission.

1674
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:58,760
Hold Sanheba to buy time for the main force to retreat.

1675
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:00,180
Heaven is waiting for you!

1676
01:54:00,840 --> 01:54:01,670
Get ready!

1677
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:02,390
Yes, sir!

1678
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:03,830
Kill!

1679
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:05,190
Be a warrior

1680
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:06,230
but not a martyr!

1681
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:07,870
Be a warrior

1682
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:08,980
but not a martyr!

1683
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:10,630
Be a warrior

1684
01:56:10,720 --> 01:56:11,590
but not a martyr!

1685
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:24,430
Liu Song!

1686
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:26,910
Hurry!

1687
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:31,910
The detonator!

1688
01:57:45,040 --> 01:57:46,750
Right turn!

1689
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:07,270
Salute!

1690
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:49,230
Give everyone from Huangpu

1691
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:51,310
an elaborate funeral.

1692
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:14,670
You the 73rd Regiment?

1693
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:17,510
You the 73rd Regiment?

1694
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:22,230
Su Yu,

1695
01:59:24,640 --> 01:59:25,350
you are late.

1696
01:59:27,120 --> 01:59:27,750
Sanheba...

1697
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:29,910
You didn't see...

1698
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:36,310
How is it on your side?

1699
01:59:38,800 --> 01:59:40,390
Our main force was ambushed

1700
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,220
in the Chaozhou-Shantou region.

1701
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:48,700
So many men

1702
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:49,670
were killed this way?

1703
01:59:55,080 --> 01:59:55,750
What happened?

1704
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:01,190
Where is the main force now?

1705
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:04,030
There were just too many of them.

1706
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:07,110
We fired every single bullet we had.

1707
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:09,870
Commander Ye Ting and He Long

1708
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:12,190
both broke through and are now missing.

1709
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:15,350
Comrade Zhou Enlai became very ill

1710
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:18,110
and was sent to Hong Kong.

1711
02:00:21,200 --> 02:00:22,070
We have failed.

1712
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:38,820
Someday,

1713
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:41,670
we will avenge all the martyrs we have lost.

1714
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:47,430
I promise you that I will seize Nanjing

1715
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:49,670
and destroy our enemies.

1716
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:51,550
Su Yu, return to your unit!

1717
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:52,350
Yes, sir!

1718
02:00:52,720 --> 02:00:55,070
73rd Regiment, assemble!

1719
02:00:57,840 --> 02:00:58,820
Attention!

1720
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:03,270
Comrades,

1721
02:01:04,120 --> 02:01:06,070
Chiang Kai-shek has betrayed the revolution

1722
02:01:06,360 --> 02:01:07,420
and has slaughtered the revolutionaries.

1723
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,870
Now we have no choice but to launch this revolt.

1724
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:11,430
The Nanchang Insurrection

1725
02:01:12,120 --> 02:01:13,510
is proof to the entire world

1726
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:14,950
that we are still alive.

1727
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:19,150
Constant fighting has caused

1728
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:22,190
our once great army of 20,000 strong,

1729
02:01:23,160 --> 02:01:24,910
to be reduced to 800.

1730
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:27,790
These souls baptized by fire,

1731
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:31,070
will merge with people's destiny.

1732
02:01:31,560 --> 02:01:33,550
From now on, people will believe us,

1733
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:35,270
support us

1734
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:38,630
and fight together for the establishment of a new China.

1735
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:42,430
In the past, I was a Nationalist lieutenant general

1736
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:44,270
From today

1737
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:45,620
I am just like you,

1738
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:47,910
a new soldier of the revolutionary army.

1739
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:52,030
Everything we do today

1740
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:54,230
is with the highest honor!

1741
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:59,190
Yes!

1742
02:02:20,640 --> 02:02:21,990
Zhu De disappeared.

1743
02:02:22,240 --> 02:02:23,380
Mao Zedong vanished.

1744
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:25,510
Zhou Enlai, He Long,

1745
02:02:25,720 --> 02:02:27,430
Ye Ting... nearly all of them are nowhere to be found.

1746
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:28,750
Music.

1747
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:30,340
Even if they are still alive,

1748
02:02:30,640 --> 02:02:31,780
they are like wandering ghosts

1749
02:02:32,040 --> 02:02:32,990
and their days are numbered.

1750
02:02:33,720 --> 02:02:34,940
The Party members' reinvestigation,

1751
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:36,190
how is it going?

1752
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:37,790
The report says it's going very smoothly.

1753
02:02:38,240 --> 02:02:39,990
Before the purging, we had more than 1 million members

1754
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:41,950
and after re-registration we have 700,000.

1755
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:45,950
When did those Communist dogs gain 300,000 new members?

1756
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:47,510
Not that many.

1757
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:49,750
Quite a few old members did not register again.

1758
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:51,510
So in other words, they were automatically withdrawn from the Nationalist Party.

1759
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:52,110
Commander in Chief,

1760
02:02:52,240 --> 02:02:53,110
Madam, water.

1761
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:55,110
According to the report,

1762
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:57,190
nearly half all members have quit the party

1763
02:02:57,360 --> 02:02:58,670
and new members

1764
02:02:58,690 --> 02:03:00,270
from various places have filled in.

1765
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:01,710
What kind of people are they?

1766
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:05,180
Local tyrants, evil gentry, bandits and despots.

1767
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:09,270
Mao Zedong, a peasant.

1768
02:03:09,600 --> 02:03:10,790
Zhu De, an army riffraff.

1769
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:12,870
Zhou Enlai, an intellectual.

1770
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:14,310
What do they have to rival me?

1771
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:16,590
In 10 years,

1772
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:19,630
let's see which side still has its flag waving high!

1773
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:53,710
Mr. Zhou,

1774
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:55,670
Madam Deng has commanded

1775
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:57,270
that you must take time to rest.

1776
02:03:59,120 --> 02:04:00,990
Zhu De finally broke through several blockades

1777
02:04:02,120 --> 02:04:03,180
and is leading his troops

1778
02:04:03,960 --> 02:04:05,790
to the boundary of Hu'nan and Jiangxi

1779
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:08,870
to meet Mao Zedong's troops.

1780
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:10,550
Mao Zedong has troops as well?

1781
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:13,750
Over the past few years

1782
02:04:14,080 --> 02:04:16,030
Mao Zedong has traveled through Hu'nan's villages

1783
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:17,150
studying China's conditions.

1784
02:04:17,680 --> 02:04:18,900
After leaving Wuhan,

1785
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:20,990
he went to the border of Hu'nan and Jiangxi

1786
02:04:21,320 --> 02:04:22,790
and established an armed force of workers and peasants.

1787
02:04:24,120 --> 02:04:25,590
Now they are together

1788
02:04:26,120 --> 02:04:27,950
and a hope is born for China's future.

1789
02:04:28,240 --> 02:04:29,380
China's revolution

1790
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:30,870
still depends on you.

1791
02:04:33,080 --> 02:04:34,590
It depends on many people.

1792
02:04:35,720 --> 02:04:37,790
Zhu De, He Long, Ye Ting,

1793
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:40,030
and thousands of generals and soldiers.

1794
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:43,150
Well, this body of mine has failed me.

1795
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:44,790
At this critical moment

1796
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:46,670
I must recuperate in Hong Kong.

1797
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:51,310
During the Huangma Uprising, Pan Zhongru, Cao Xuekai and others

1798
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:52,860
fought and won a little piece of heaven on earth.

1799
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:54,710
I hear He Long is doing quite well in western Hu'nan.

1800
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:55,670
It's impressive.

1801
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:56,990
In the New Year's eve uprising in South Hu'nan,

1802
02:04:57,360 --> 02:04:58,950
Commander Zhu gathered a force of more than 10,000 men.

1803
02:04:59,080 --> 02:05:00,750
Xu Xiangqian led the workers' red guards

1804
02:05:00,760 --> 02:05:02,030
and joined an uprising in Guangzhou.

1805
02:05:02,160 --> 02:05:04,110
Peng Dehuai is also planning an uprising in Pingjiang County, Hu'nan.

1806
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:05,950
I heard that

1807
02:05:05,960 --> 02:05:08,390
Zhu De is leading his troops to come to Jinggangshan.

1808
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:09,350
That's right.

1809
02:05:10,120 --> 02:05:11,150
I can hardly wait.

1810
02:05:16,840 --> 02:05:18,950
Commissioner Mao,

1811
02:05:19,880 --> 02:05:21,310
the comrades who joined the uprising in South Hu'nan are here.

1812
02:05:21,400 --> 02:05:22,310
Zhu De is here as well.

1813
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:24,350
Come, let us welcome them!

1814
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:34,670
Comrade Zhu De,

1815
02:05:34,840 --> 02:05:35,670
after the failure in the Chaozhou-Shantou Region,

1816
02:05:36,040 --> 02:05:37,230
your army had a bloody battle in Sanheba alone.

1817
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:38,030
And after marching for thousands of miles,

1818
02:05:38,120 --> 02:05:40,030
800 defeated men became a force of more than 10,000 strong.

1819
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:41,630
The pillar of strength in our revolution

1820
02:05:41,800 --> 02:05:42,780
has been no one but you!

1821
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:44,510
I have long heard of you and your work, Zedong.

1822
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:46,870
To establish a base in barren mountains that range for miles and miles,

1823
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:49,190
is something only a hero could achieve.

1824
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:51,190
I have eight words hidden in my heart:

1825
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:54,150
"So many extreme difficulties and a narrow escape."

1826
02:05:54,400 --> 02:05:55,950
I also have 8 words for you,

1827
02:05:55,960 --> 02:05:57,150
for Dr. Sun Yat-sen,

1828
02:05:57,360 --> 02:05:58,950
for Chiang Kai-shek and for all of our enemies:

1829
02:06:09,880 --> 02:06:11,070
"A single spark

1830
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:13,190
can start a wild fire."

1831
02:06:22,280 --> 02:06:22,990
Salute!

1832
02:06:28,240 --> 02:06:28,990
The new China

1833
02:06:30,280 --> 02:06:31,110
depends on you!

1834
02:07:33,320 --> 02:07:34,870
"In September 1927, Mao Zedong led the famous Sanwan Reorganization,

1835
02:07:34,910 --> 02:07:36,450
"which founded the system under the leadership of the CCP.

1836
02:07:36,500 --> 02:07:38,040
"In December 1929, the Fourth Red Army held the 9th meeting of the CCP,

1837
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:39,620
"which saw the adoption of the Gutian Congress Resolution,

1838
02:07:39,660 --> 02:07:41,200
"established the principle to build the Party ideologically and the Army politically

1839
02:07:41,250 --> 02:07:42,790
"and pointed the way to construct a new proletarian People's Army.

1840
02:07:42,830 --> 02:07:44,660
"The Red Army had thus entered into a new era and began to develop and grow."

1841
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:46,390
The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army

1842
02:07:46,760 --> 02:07:49,350
is an armed body that can carry out the political tasks of the revolution.

1843
02:07:49,640 --> 02:07:51,750
This is the valuable experience

1844
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:53,030
we gathered from our bitter struggles.

1845
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:54,190
Well said!

1846
02:07:54,600 --> 02:07:55,990
I, Zhu De, hereby bear witness.

1847
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:56,910
I as well!

1848
02:07:57,200 --> 02:07:57,750
I also!

1849
02:07:57,960 --> 02:07:58,550
The Red Army

1850
02:07:59,280 --> 02:08:00,340
is the people's army.

1851
02:08:00,720 --> 02:08:02,310
Besides fighting to destroy the enemy's military strength,

1852
02:08:03,320 --> 02:08:04,110
it should shoulder such important tasks

1853
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:05,670
as providing propaganda to the people,

1854
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:07,310
organizing the masses,

1855
02:08:07,720 --> 02:08:09,550
and arming them. These are it's primary duties.

1856
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:12,310
The central task and the highest form of revolution

1857
02:08:12,720 --> 02:08:14,030
is the seizure of power by an armed force.

1858
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:16,030
We will arm our troops

1859
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:17,790
with proletarian ideology

1860
02:08:18,400 --> 02:08:19,710
as a force to correct all errant ideas.

1861
02:08:21,080 --> 02:08:22,060
Our principle is that

1862
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:23,510
the Party commands the gun.
