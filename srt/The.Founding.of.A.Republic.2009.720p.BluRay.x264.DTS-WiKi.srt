1
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:09,210
Director Chen, it appears

2
00:02:09,218 --> 00:02:13,180
you will kiss and make up with the CPC.

3
00:02:13,197 --> 00:02:15,213
You don't approve?

4
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:18,247
You don't know the CPC

5
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,247
like we do.

6
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,405
While you were making passes at them,

7
00:02:22,414 --> 00:02:23,470
we fought them head on

8
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:25,474
in France.

9
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,306
I heard you intend to resign.

10
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:40,388
Even if you resign,

11
00:02:40,395 --> 00:02:42,530
wait till after the capitulation ceremony in Nanjing

12
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:44,605
You helped defeat the Japanese.

13
00:02:45,471 --> 00:02:49,515
The ceremony needs a national hero like you.

14
00:02:51,464 --> 00:02:53,481
If I don't resign,

15
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:55,506
I'll be blamed for the civil war.

16
00:02:55,584 --> 00:02:56,710
Welcome, Mr. Mao

17
00:02:59,755 --> 00:03:01,724
Welcome to Chongqing, Mr. Mao.

18
00:03:03,602 --> 00:03:05,607
We've been fighting the enemy

19
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,563
for 8 years.

20
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:08,802
It's my job

21
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:09,770
to fight till the end.

22
00:03:10,644 --> 00:03:11,783
Now that we won,

23
00:03:11,793 --> 00:03:13,810
why

24
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,704
are we stilling fighting?

25
00:03:16,749 --> 00:03:19,655
I will not

26
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,701
fight my own kind.

27
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,894
General Malinovsky has agreed

28
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:25,882
to hand over the Northeast provinces.

29
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,832
No need to fight anymore?

30
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,664
If we don't,

31
00:03:31,672 --> 00:03:32,811
will the CPC hand over their turf?

32
00:03:32,902 --> 00:03:35,819
Ladies and gentlemen.

33
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:38,882
Chairman Chiang and Mr. Mao propose a toast

34
00:03:39,743 --> 00:03:41,830
To peace, cheers.

35
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:43,670
Cheers.

36
00:04:04,726 --> 00:04:05,710
Chairman Chiang.

37
00:04:05,727 --> 00:04:06,795
Hello, Chairman Chiang

38
00:04:06,806 --> 00:04:07,778
Hello, Mr. Mao.

39
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:09,766
I'm from the "Central Daily".

40
00:04:09,777 --> 00:04:11,829
I notice you're both wearing Mandarin suit.

41
00:04:11,848 --> 00:04:13,900
On a special day like today,

42
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:17,847
is there a special meaning for that?

43
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,832
The Mandarin suit

44
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,727
is the official attire for all civil servants of the Nationalist Government.

45
00:04:31,741 --> 00:04:33,709
As the Chairman

46
00:04:33,721 --> 00:04:35,832
of KMT,

47
00:04:35,841 --> 00:04:38,806
it's my duty

48
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:41,893
to welcome Mr. Mao to Chongqing.

49
00:04:41,902 --> 00:04:45,864
I'm wearing the Mandarin suit out of respect.

50
00:04:46,702 --> 00:04:48,885
Mr Mao, is that your reason too?

51
00:04:49,783 --> 00:04:51,764
The reason is simple

52
00:04:51,773 --> 00:04:55,735
Chairman Chiang and I are both Dr. Sun's disciples.

53
00:04:55,744 --> 00:04:57,796
Both the KMT and the CPC have inherited

54
00:04:57,815 --> 00:05:01,694
Dr. Sun's revolutionary legacy.

55
00:05:01,705 --> 00:05:04,908
We share the same roots.

56
00:05:04,915 --> 00:05:07,845
It is only natural that

57
00:05:07,856 --> 00:05:09,801
Dr. Sun's disciples should wear the Mandarin suits

58
00:05:09,816 --> 00:05:11,738
Mr. Mao. Excuse me.

59
00:05:12,716 --> 00:05:14,756
Pardon me, Mr Mao.

60
00:05:15,797 --> 00:05:18,810
To see you standing next to each other,

61
00:05:20,757 --> 00:05:22,702
I can't help but feel excited

62
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:24,841
I have another question for Mr. Mao

63
00:05:24,848 --> 00:05:28,810
In the upcoming negotiation

64
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,727
ith regards to the issue of democracy,

65
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:32,791
will the Parties find common ground

66
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:33,853
or reach any consensus?

67
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:37,863
Definitely, if you look hard enough.

68
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,789
This reporter already noticed

69
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,750
we had something in common.

70
00:05:48,852 --> 00:05:51,711
The North China division of the CPC

71
00:05:51,822 --> 00:05:53,684
and the Shandong division

72
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:55,742
are infiltrating the Northeast

73
00:05:55,753 --> 00:05:56,903
Chen Yi's New Fourth Army

74
00:05:56,913 --> 00:05:59,843
is active around Shanghai and Hangzhou,

75
00:05:59,854 --> 00:06:04,789
making it difficult for the Nationalist Government to move the capital back to Nanjing.

76
00:06:05,704 --> 00:06:08,908
Our troops are too far away from these regions.

77
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:10,896
The Americans have landed in Qingdao.

78
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,838
They promised to send planes and warships

79
00:06:12,855 --> 00:06:14,764
to get our troops to the Northeast, North China,

80
00:06:14,776 --> 00:06:16,709
East China and south of Yangtze River

81
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:19,727
General Du, I'm counting on you in the Northeast

82
00:06:28,828 --> 00:06:31,804
Master Zhang, please give us your honest opinion.

83
00:06:31,818 --> 00:06:33,751
The CPC

84
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,725
likes to keep things in the open.

85
00:06:35,739 --> 00:06:38,693
We never hide our views

86
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:41,874
and respect those of our friends and the China Democratic League.

87
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,849
Sir?

88
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:46,765
Thank you.

89
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:51,702
I'll be honest with you, as a friend.

90
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,923
To form a democratic coalition government,

91
00:06:54,932 --> 00:07:00,804
peace and unity are the only ways forward.

92
00:07:00,822 --> 00:07:04,807
If Mr. Chiang and Mr. Mao can sit down and talk,

93
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:07,848
it would be wonderful

94
00:07:07,863 --> 00:07:11,754
A negotiation requires concessions and compromises

95
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,825
in order to bring about peace

96
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,918
Chairman Mao came to Chongqing

97
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:21,707
That alone proves our sincerity.

98
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:24,904
The turf and army are minor details.

99
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:29,851
Rather than haggle over them,

100
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:33,699
why not unify all the parties?

101
00:07:33,707 --> 00:07:34,928
At this moment,

102
00:07:34,937 --> 00:07:39,718
the Nationalist Army is busy

103
00:07:39,728 --> 00:07:41,898
in regions where we have set up our regime

104
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:45,798
with strategic blockades or explorative attacks.

105
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:48,726
The Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army

106
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:51,751
are thorns in Mr. Chiang's flesh.

107
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,776
Pardon me for saying this

108
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,877
If we didn't have a few hundred thousand used guns,

109
00:07:56,771 --> 00:07:59,855
Mr. Chiang would never sit down and talk to us.

110
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:01,923
Ze

111
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:05,704
If neither Party let go,

112
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:07,773
the war will go on.

113
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:11,857
You can forget about peace.

114
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:14,814
If neither Party gives in,

115
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:17,705
negotiation will break down.

116
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:19,836
I appreciate

117
00:08:19,854 --> 00:08:22,808
your mediation.

118
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:24,733
Very well.

119
00:08:24,744 --> 00:08:27,840
For the sake of peace and democracy,

120
00:08:27,855 --> 00:08:29,741
we'll make the first concession

121
00:08:29,845 --> 00:08:32,716
Among the 100 divisions of the national defense army,

122
00:08:32,725 --> 00:08:34,753
our request for 48 divisions

123
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:36,747
has been cut back to 20 divisions

124
00:08:36,756 --> 00:08:37,871
We're willing to give up 8 liberated regions

125
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,714
in south of Yangtze River.

126
00:08:39,726 --> 00:08:40,912
I hope that our concession

127
00:08:40,926 --> 00:08:43,749
will set the consultative meeting in motion

128
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:46,744
and help set up a coalition government.

129
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:59,944
I'm here on behalf of President Truman and the United States government

130
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:01,904
to issue the following statement.

131
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,063
We have no intention to support

132
00:09:04,071 --> 00:09:08,034
a Cream of Wheat" Marxist to take over China.

133
00:09:09,946 --> 00:09:13,991
The present Nationalist Government of China and Mr. Chiang Kai-shek

134
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:16,868
are faithful friends of the United States.

135
00:09:16,882 --> 00:09:18,934
Our only concern is

136
00:09:18,943 --> 00:09:24,863
whether the Yalta Conference and

137
00:09:25,008 --> 00:09:29,884
the Sino-Russian Friendship Alliance Treaty

138
00:09:29,901 --> 00:09:32,095
will be honored and implemented by the Chongqing government.

139
00:09:32,974 --> 00:09:35,002
The United States is cognizant that

140
00:09:35,016 --> 00:09:38,930
the Nationalist government of China is a one-party government

141
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:43,894
and believes that peace, unity and democratic reform in China

142
00:09:43,903 --> 00:09:46,928
can be furthered if the basis of this government

143
00:09:46,944 --> 00:09:49,921
is broadened to include

144
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:51,111
other political elements in the country.

145
00:09:52,109 --> 00:09:57,044
On behalf of the CPC, I wish to issue the following statement.

146
00:09:57,113 --> 00:10:00,932
We welcome President Truman's China policy as per the declaration on the 15th

147
00:10:00,946 --> 00:10:04,125
with regards to the cease fire

148
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:06,913
between the KMT, CPC

149
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:09,020
and other political parties

150
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,420
and to call upon a multi-party meeting

151
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:14,081
to implement reforms

152
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:15,922
to end the KMT's one-party dictatorship

153
00:10:16,087 --> 00:10:18,127
and to ensure fair and

154
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:22,018
effective representation of all parties

155
00:10:22,032 --> 00:10:27,002
to facilitate the democratic unification of China.

156
00:10:29,978 --> 00:10:31,117
President Truman's special envoy,

157
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:33,929
Marshall, is arriving soon

158
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:36,995
to mediate in the civil war.

159
00:10:37,074 --> 00:10:39,137
Don't slight him.

160
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:42,105
Peace or war,

161
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:45,118
you should know better.

162
00:10:48,012 --> 00:10:52,033
Stop when we want to stop

163
00:10:52,045 --> 00:10:55,129
Fight when we want to fight.

164
00:10:58,971 --> 00:11:01,936
This is the only case.

165
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:06,069
Not until we say so.

166
00:11:08,037 --> 00:11:10,054
The purpose of this Assembly

167
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:13,154
is to seek political reforms towards democracy.

168
00:11:13,182 --> 00:11:15,126
The basis of our negotiation

169
00:11:15,143 --> 00:11:20,006
is to establish a multi-party coalition government

170
00:11:20,017 --> 00:11:23,160
to facilitate a peaceful unification.

171
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:27,108
Kai,

172
00:11:27,122 --> 00:11:30,016
there are over 30 seats in the Senate.

173
00:11:30,025 --> 00:11:32,088
We have to give up 8 of them?

174
00:11:33,007 --> 00:11:35,035
To give up 8 seats

175
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:37,171
is to oust 8 of our men

176
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,035
and hand them to someone else

177
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:45,101
Who owns the world now? It's hardly KMT.

178
00:11:45,116 --> 00:11:47,120
Father

179
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:50,045
Central Club and the others have secretly agreed

180
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:52,977
not to acknowledge the CPPCC

181
00:11:52,992 --> 00:11:57,998
and refused to give up their seats for the CDL and CPC.

182
00:11:58,006 --> 00:11:59,168
There'II be trouble

183
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:04,005
if they keep this up.

184
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:10,082
Fellow students, teachers

185
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:12,194
and friends of Sichuan.

186
00:12:12,206 --> 00:12:15,160
5 months ago, we gathered here

187
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:19,010
to celebrate a national victory.

188
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:22,046
That's outrageous. Lower your whip.

189
00:12:22,064 --> 00:12:24,033
Mind your own business.

190
00:12:24,116 --> 00:12:26,144
She's my girl.

191
00:12:26,158 --> 00:12:28,162
You have no say

192
00:12:32,122 --> 00:12:34,139
Whoever feeds her,

193
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,146
owns her

194
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:41,164
Hey Stop it.

195
00:12:56,061 --> 00:12:57,140
Are you alright, Miss?

196
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,181
Who fired that shot? Who was it?

197
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:15,197
Who was it? Who fired that shot?

198
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,227
Sir.

199
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:26,199
No open fire in the city, Sir.

200
00:13:26,214 --> 00:13:28,182
But they can beat people up?

201
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,157
I don't care who you work for.

202
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:38,243
Send a message for me.

203
00:13:39,204 --> 00:13:42,229
Don't sneak around.

204
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:44,109
Stop this underhanded nonsense

205
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:54,233
Extra: Mr. Chiang calls for a meeting.

206
00:13:54,265 --> 00:13:55,189
Newspaper.

207
00:13:56,227 --> 00:13:58,125
Here

208
00:14:05,113 --> 00:14:06,299
Chiang has taken the gloves off.

209
00:14:06,314 --> 00:14:09,244
He's calling the National People's Congress without us.

210
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,297
It's his one-man show.

211
00:14:32,155 --> 00:14:35,334
The sooner we set the date for the NPC,

212
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:40,161
the sooner the US will confirm their assistance.

213
00:14:43,293 --> 00:14:48,263
We can't have the NPC with the KMT alone.

214
00:14:50,168 --> 00:14:53,253
We can forget the CPC.

215
00:14:54,281 --> 00:15:00,117
For appearance, we still have the other parties

216
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,231
The CPC and the other parties

217
00:15:07,242 --> 00:15:10,183
insisted on implementing the resolution of the CPPCC in Chongqing.

218
00:15:10,264 --> 00:15:13,288
What will you do?

219
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:19,278
Pacify Zhang Lan.

220
00:15:20,331 --> 00:15:24,316
Coax and fight the CPC at the same time.

221
00:15:25,356 --> 00:15:28,191
When Mao runs out of troops,

222
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:30,371
we can stop coaxing.

223
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,279
4 days ago in Kunming, Mr. Li Gongpu

224
00:16:02,244 --> 00:16:05,293
was murdered by secret agents of the KMT.

225
00:16:05,306 --> 00:16:09,399
What crime has he committed to deserve such a fate?

226
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,407
He used his pen and he spoke up.

227
00:16:14,383 --> 00:16:16,399
Everything he wrote and said

228
00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:20,210
was precisely what any Chinese with a conscience

229
00:16:20,227 --> 00:16:22,196
should write and speak of.

230
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,414
What a shame.

231
00:16:28,364 --> 00:16:31,246
The counter-revolutionaries' shame

232
00:16:32,347 --> 00:16:36,237
is precisely Mr. Li's honor

233
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:42,221
His blood will not be shed in vain

234
00:16:44,216 --> 00:16:46,220
Mr Li gave up his life

235
00:16:46,247 --> 00:16:48,216
There's a price to be paid for his life.

236
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,394
Justice will prevail,

237
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:58,426
because truth will prevail

238
00:16:58,447 --> 00:17:10,263
We want democracy, not civil war.

239
00:18:17,437 --> 00:18:19,311
Tell him I went out.

240
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:23,405
Sir.

241
00:18:26,344 --> 00:18:28,443
The Chairman is not here for real.

242
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:33,299
He sent me on an overseas expedition.

243
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,355
I came to say goodbye to my sworn brother.

244
00:18:37,323 --> 00:18:38,413
But he's not here

245
00:18:39,414 --> 00:18:43,293
Vice President, why the lantern?

246
00:18:43,308 --> 00:18:44,529
It's broad daylight.

247
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:48,428
Daylight?

248
00:18:50,473 --> 00:18:52,501
I see only darkness.

249
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:55,395
I can't see without a lantern.

250
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:56,520
You must be kidding, Sir.

251
00:18:56,538 --> 00:18:59,313
I'm not in the mood

252
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:03,326
"The Three Principles of the People" is the cornerstone of our Party

253
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:05,547
If he's bent on having his way,

254
00:19:06,465 --> 00:19:10,451
the days of our Party are numbered.

255
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,352
That's all I have to say.

256
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,524
Tell him to take care

257
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:23,389
Zhangjiakou is the capital of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region,

258
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,370
it's also the only major city under the CPC

259
00:19:26,491 --> 00:19:28,530
that has an arsenal that's crucial to them.

260
00:19:29,423 --> 00:19:32,554
But it'll be returned to the Nationalist Government soon.

261
00:19:34,427 --> 00:19:36,455
General, are you saying

262
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:38,532
the manufacturing and military base of the CPC

263
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:40,389
doesn't exist any more?

264
00:19:41,392 --> 00:19:43,574
I admire Mao for never giving up.

265
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:46,383
But talk is cheap

266
00:19:46,426 --> 00:19:47,470
and you can't just work your finger to the bone

267
00:19:47,557 --> 00:19:49,515
Power is everything.

268
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:51,550
According to you,

269
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,356
the Communist Party is doomed to fail this time?

270
00:19:58,445 --> 00:19:59,549
I didn't say that

271
00:20:01,538 --> 00:20:03,412
I'll make you a wager.

272
00:20:03,589 --> 00:20:05,475
The CPC wins,

273
00:20:05,491 --> 00:20:09,405
I'm willing to hold Mao's horsewhip.

274
00:20:12,466 --> 00:20:14,482
20 years ago,

275
00:20:14,498 --> 00:20:16,574
we surrendered our arms

276
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,582
for peace.

277
00:20:18,591 --> 00:20:22,505
What happened? We got a massacre in return,

278
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:25,373
not peace.

279
00:20:25,386 --> 00:20:27,533
We learn from our mistakes

280
00:20:27,547 --> 00:20:30,548
For peace,

281
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,561
for our future and to eliminate war.

282
00:20:33,572 --> 00:20:37,404
In this war imposed on us by our enemies,

283
00:20:37,425 --> 00:20:38,528
we must retaliate.

284
00:20:39,397 --> 00:20:43,430
Within 3 months of the closing of this NPC,

285
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,524
our government

286
00:20:47,403 --> 00:20:48,601
will put an end to this civil war.

287
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:53,478
We will annihilate the separatist regime by force of arms

288
00:20:53,488 --> 00:20:56,524
to bring forth a unified country

289
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,505
and bring peace to our nation.

290
00:21:32,437 --> 00:21:35,474
Some say the evacuation from Yan'an

291
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:38,551
marks a major setback in the Chinese Revolution.

292
00:21:38,562 --> 00:21:41,492
If this is a setback,

293
00:21:41,505 --> 00:21:44,530
our party and this army

294
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:48,582
have survived countless setbacks.

295
00:21:49,451 --> 00:21:53,663
You keep the land and lose the people, you lose both.

296
00:21:53,674 --> 00:21:58,491
You keep the people and lose the land, you have both

297
00:21:58,508 --> 00:22:02,625
I'll trade Yan'an for the whole of China.

298
00:22:10,687 --> 00:22:13,641
We came all this way

299
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:16,531
but we're still one step away from peace

300
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:20,611
What a shame to give it up

301
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:24,493
Mao was right: Without guns in their hands,

302
00:22:24,508 --> 00:22:27,509
Chiang will never negotiate with us

303
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:30,557
The CDL served as mediator between the KMT and CPC.

304
00:22:30,573 --> 00:22:33,538
But Chiang is insatiable.

305
00:22:33,555 --> 00:22:35,476
The CPC gave up their turf,

306
00:22:35,486 --> 00:22:37,502
but they did not get the peace they wanted.

307
00:22:38,568 --> 00:22:42,661
Some guarantor I am.

308
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,507
Chiang wants a one-party NPC.

309
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:49,480
If neither the CPC or CDL shows up,

310
00:22:49,497 --> 00:22:51,632
we'll be handing the regime to him.

311
00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:53,701
Don't be stupid

312
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,557
We'll fall into his trap if we show up.

313
00:22:56,573 --> 00:22:58,696
Our position is clear.

314
00:22:58,714 --> 00:23:01,573
Only a coalition government is legal

315
00:23:02,517 --> 00:23:06,586
There'll be no NPC without peace

316
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:10,524
and no coalition government without political consultancy.

317
00:23:12,645 --> 00:23:14,649
You're saying...

318
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:21,526
We side with the CPC

319
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:25,580
I, Zhang Lan,

320
00:23:25,594 --> 00:23:27,730
will not attend Chiang's NPC.

321
00:23:28,527 --> 00:23:29,702
Based on the experience of the Northeast Bureau,

322
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,602
we implement land reforms in the countryside.

323
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,529
The results are quite obvious.

324
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:36,618
Stay off the main road, take the vicinity of the city,

325
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:37,737
give the land to the farmers.

326
00:23:37,744 --> 00:23:41,576
We'll take over when those who plough the land can own it

327
00:23:42,768 --> 00:23:46,576
The supplies unit got separated.

328
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,595
We have problems with food and clothes.

329
00:23:52,636 --> 00:23:53,549
Zedong.

330
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,636
Mr. Chairman.

331
00:23:54,647 --> 00:23:56,759
I need to write an editorial for the Xinhua News Agency.

332
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,664
I need the rest of this candle for later

333
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,675
But we're having a meeting.

334
00:24:01,693 --> 00:24:05,715
Precisely, just keep talking.

335
00:24:05,726 --> 00:24:07,648
You don't need to see anything

336
00:24:07,657 --> 00:24:09,661
Groping in the dark?

337
00:24:12,641 --> 00:24:14,753
Let's get back to business.

338
00:24:14,762 --> 00:24:17,739
Chiang threw caution to the wind and declared war.

339
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:19,605
Bullets don't have eyes.

340
00:24:21,768 --> 00:24:23,785
In my opinion,

341
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:26,670
Enlai, Bishi and I

342
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:29,787
will form a front committee and stay in Shanbei

343
00:24:31,716 --> 00:24:35,796
Shaoqi, you and Zhu De form a Central Working Committee

344
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:38,680
and cross the Yellow River into North China.

345
00:24:38,691 --> 00:24:40,601
We'll work from both sides

346
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:43,684
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

347
00:24:43,695 --> 00:24:45,628
Keep them separate.

348
00:24:45,637 --> 00:24:47,795
We'II still have the other when one is crushed

349
00:24:59,747 --> 00:25:00,791
Hurry. Get out

350
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:03,772
Get rid of everyone inside.

351
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,824
Seal up this place

352
00:25:09,715 --> 00:25:11,719
That son of a bitch

353
00:25:11,746 --> 00:25:13,750
He had the audacity to seize the CDL headquarters

354
00:25:13,758 --> 00:25:14,825
and restrict our activities.

355
00:25:22,645 --> 00:25:24,827
Li Jishen and He Xiangning

356
00:25:24,836 --> 00:25:27,731
set up the Revolutionary Committee of the KMT in Hong Kong.

357
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,823
Founding members such as Feng Yuxiang and Cai Tingkai

358
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,779
have indicated their intention to break away from Chiang

359
00:25:35,695 --> 00:25:37,818
The KMT is splitting up.

360
00:25:37,846 --> 00:25:39,780
You should leave for Hong Kong right away

361
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:43,761
We'll re-open the CDL headquarters in Hong Kong

362
00:25:43,771 --> 00:25:44,826
But...

363
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:46,799
I'm all for it

364
00:25:46,814 --> 00:25:48,818
We must not miss this chance.

365
00:26:47,801 --> 00:26:49,817
I hereby announce

366
00:26:49,832 --> 00:26:53,759
the results of the first presidential election of the Republic of China

367
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:04,715
with the following votes:

368
00:27:09,777 --> 00:27:13,799
Chiang Kai-shek 2, 430 votes;

369
00:27:14,752 --> 00:27:17,907
Ju Zheng 269 votes.

370
00:27:17,923 --> 00:27:22,846
According to the constitution of the ROC and electoral law,

371
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:23,913
I hereby announce

372
00:27:23,928 --> 00:27:29,753
Mr. Chiang Kai-shek is elected first President of the ROC

373
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:39,741
Congratulations.

374
00:27:41,842 --> 00:27:43,764
Congrats

375
00:27:48,807 --> 00:27:51,714
Hu Zongnan wired. We lost Yan'an

376
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:05,812
Chiang Kai-shek was elected President in Nanjing.

377
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,833
Long live Mao Zedong in the valley.

378
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,882
Nothing to brag about

379
00:28:12,866 --> 00:28:17,742
Get rid of the 'Iong live' in clause 23 of the slogan.

380
00:28:17,979 --> 00:28:21,870
Let Chiang be the emperor.

381
00:28:21,883 --> 00:28:23,792
I won't join his party

382
00:28:26,766 --> 00:28:29,743
Clause 5,

383
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:34,788
mere mention of the working class is inappropriate.

384
00:28:35,843 --> 00:28:39,900
We have insisted on a coalition government

385
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:42,906
It's bad to sing a different tune.

386
00:28:44,771 --> 00:28:46,977
I agree with the amendments.

387
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:50,882
Let's have a show of hands

388
00:28:58,941 --> 00:29:00,874
Go on air with this.

389
00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:11,919
Xinhua Radio broadcasts

390
00:29:11,931 --> 00:29:16,011
the CPC slogan for Labor Day on May 1.

391
00:29:16,025 --> 00:29:18,895
First, this year's Labor Day

392
00:29:18,907 --> 00:29:21,932
is the day the Chinese people head towards victory.

393
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,880
Second, this year's Labor Day

394
00:29:24,891 --> 00:29:27,003
is the day the Chinese people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek

395
00:29:27,013 --> 00:29:28,887
meets his doom.

396
00:29:29,035 --> 00:29:32,914
Fifth, all democratic parties and organizations

397
00:29:32,927 --> 00:29:36,925
should immediately call for the CPPCC

398
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:40,001
to discuss and elect delegates

399
00:29:40,012 --> 00:29:42,966
to set up a coalition government.

400
00:29:43,876 --> 00:29:47,920
The CPC made an excellent move

401
00:29:50,821 --> 00:29:52,885
You're the chess expert.

402
00:29:52,902 --> 00:29:55,844
This time you must make up your mind.

403
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:04,814
It's easier said than done.

404
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:09,037
It'll depend on the CPC's next move

405
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:15,824
I heard Li Zongren had invited you to Nanjing.

406
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,055
Chiang wants you too.

407
00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:27,601
Li Zongren.

408
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:31,640
Sun Ke

409
00:30:31,651 --> 00:30:34,473
Li Zongren.

410
00:30:34,483 --> 00:30:36,487
If the President is a litearati,

411
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:38,602
I don't mind if you become Vice President

412
00:30:39,595 --> 00:30:41,552
But the President is already a soldier

413
00:30:42,487 --> 00:30:46,473
The Vice President should not be another soldier.

414
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,564
People will say this is a military government

415
00:30:52,553 --> 00:30:56,526
Normally, I won't insist if you say so.

416
00:30:56,545 --> 00:31:01,480
But since the election,

417
00:31:01,488 --> 00:31:05,461
more than my effort is at stake.

418
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,647
Not that I don't want to step down,

419
00:31:08,662 --> 00:31:13,537
I simply can't.

420
00:31:17,507 --> 00:31:20,496
Without support from the Party,

421
00:31:20,508 --> 00:31:22,690
you won't be elected.

422
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,689
Why be a laughing stock?

423
00:31:27,492 --> 00:31:30,647
Let the numbers speak for themselves.

424
00:31:30,664 --> 00:31:33,558
Maybe I'll win.

425
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,475
Definitely not.

426
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:02,706
Sun Ke 1, 295 votes.

427
00:32:03,682 --> 00:32:08,617
Li Zongren 1, 438 votes.

428
00:32:13,538 --> 00:32:17,595
According to the constitution of the ROC and electoral law,

429
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,540
I hereby announce, Mr. Li Zongren

430
00:32:20,552 --> 00:32:24,502
is elected Vice President of the ROC.

431
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:26,787
I

432
00:34:26,802 --> 00:34:30,575
do solemnly swear...

433
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:42,691
I haven't been to Beiping in years.

434
00:34:43,752 --> 00:34:45,601
Commander-in-Chief of North China.

435
00:34:45,613 --> 00:34:47,676
5 provinces and a few hundred thousand people under your command.

436
00:34:47,694 --> 00:34:49,675
You're the king

437
00:34:49,685 --> 00:34:51,618
Don't make fun of me.

438
00:34:51,816 --> 00:34:54,710
Mr. Chiang has high regard for you.

439
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:01,762
If the new CPPCC

440
00:35:01,772 --> 00:35:04,607
can invite half the people on this list,

441
00:35:04,613 --> 00:35:05,716
we're half way there.

442
00:35:05,724 --> 00:35:06,719
You're right.

443
00:35:06,734 --> 00:35:09,664
You better write to General Feng personally.

444
00:35:10,816 --> 00:35:13,782
I'll do that right now.

445
00:35:15,729 --> 00:35:17,828
Mr Chairman, time to eat

446
00:35:18,781 --> 00:35:20,763
Please join me, Enlai.

447
00:35:20,772 --> 00:35:22,729
No, I must get back to Xibaipo.

448
00:35:22,743 --> 00:35:24,640
Finish eating first

449
00:35:24,654 --> 00:35:25,638
Very well.

450
00:35:26,665 --> 00:35:28,658
Mr. Chairman,

451
00:35:28,677 --> 00:35:31,749
the cook is Xiao Yan's old lad

452
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,653
He wants to see you

453
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,665
Of course

454
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:39,699
Thank you, sir.

455
00:35:40,713 --> 00:35:42,681
Hurry.

456
00:35:42,804 --> 00:35:45,781
His name is Guo Bencai. He's from my hometown.

457
00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:46,709
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

458
00:35:47,847 --> 00:35:50,801
Mr. Kwok, you're a good cook.

459
00:35:50,819 --> 00:35:53,618
It's worth everything to cook for you

460
00:35:53,631 --> 00:35:54,627
Have a smoke

461
00:35:54,641 --> 00:35:55,744
Thank you, sir.

462
00:35:58,654 --> 00:36:00,730
Why...

463
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:02,843
It's your cigarette, I want to keep it.

464
00:36:04,767 --> 00:36:05,716
Take this.

465
00:36:05,727 --> 00:36:06,652
I can't.

466
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:07,652
Take it.

467
00:36:07,668 --> 00:36:07,834
Thanks

468
00:36:07,848 --> 00:36:11,692
Sir, this is Liu Congwen, the mess officer in the military zone.

469
00:36:11,861 --> 00:36:13,723
Hello, sir.

470
00:36:13,731 --> 00:36:14,703
Hello.

471
00:36:15,653 --> 00:36:16,637
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

472
00:36:16,653 --> 00:36:18,692
Hello. Mr Kwok.

473
00:36:18,704 --> 00:36:19,748
Hello.

474
00:36:19,755 --> 00:36:21,712
Mr. Chairman, any special requests for your meals?

475
00:36:21,726 --> 00:36:22,829
We'II do the best we can.

476
00:36:23,778 --> 00:36:24,857
I don't need much.

477
00:36:24,867 --> 00:36:26,789
Make sure we put in chili.

478
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,648
I prepared for you already.

479
00:36:37,755 --> 00:36:40,745
It'd be perfect

480
00:36:40,757 --> 00:36:43,794
if I can have stewed meat twice a month.

481
00:36:49,732 --> 00:36:52,721
Big fish in Chengnanzhuang

482
00:36:52,734 --> 00:36:58,724
In a bungalow between 2 apricot trees near the mountains in the northern part of the village

483
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:04,654
Per your request,

484
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:07,706
field operation units

485
00:37:07,722 --> 00:37:08,765
in Nanjing, Shanghai and Hong Kong have been removed.

486
00:37:11,684 --> 00:37:14,839
Zhang Lan is stuck in Shanghai. Keep him under tabs.

487
00:37:14,856 --> 00:37:15,876
Yes, sir

488
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:20,672
Li Jishen is in Hong Kong

489
00:37:20,689 --> 00:37:24,722
He's not on our turf. Just keep an eye on him.

490
00:37:24,731 --> 00:37:25,811
Yes, sir

491
00:37:26,863 --> 00:37:30,742
As for Feng Yuxiang,

492
00:37:30,754 --> 00:37:34,692
he's getting tight with the CPC.

493
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:41,686
He may defect

494
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,836
If necessary,

495
00:37:43,851 --> 00:37:46,734
I'll tidy things up a bit

496
00:37:48,704 --> 00:37:51,776
These are prestigious men

497
00:37:51,787 --> 00:37:53,826
If you're sloppy,

498
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,684
public opinion overseas will backfire on us

499
00:37:56,869 --> 00:37:57,912
I understand

500
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:02,711
Mao's location is confirmed?

501
00:38:02,753 --> 00:38:04,852
Chengnanzhuang in Baoding.

502
00:38:04,863 --> 00:38:07,793
He won't get away this time.

503
00:38:09,736 --> 00:38:14,837
Remember, this is extremely important.

504
00:38:17,841 --> 00:38:20,853
Confirm target, roger

505
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:44,787
Lao Guo, where are you going? This way.

506
00:38:44,796 --> 00:38:47,808
Back to the kitchen. Chairman Mao's food is on the stove

507
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:55,855
Chairman?

508
00:38:55,871 --> 00:38:57,745
He took some sleeping pills and went to sleep.

509
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:58,927
Wake him up. Enemy planes will be here soon.

510
00:38:58,943 --> 00:39:00,793
Tiger, get a stretcher.

511
00:39:00,804 --> 00:39:00,946
Yes

512
00:39:00,955 --> 00:39:04,928
Wake up, sir. Enemy planes are coming.

513
00:39:05,847 --> 00:39:06,867
They haven't dropped a bomb.

514
00:39:06,878 --> 00:39:08,942
Then it'll be too late.

515
00:39:10,771 --> 00:39:11,861
Let's go, sir

516
00:39:11,871 --> 00:39:13,804
Calm down.

517
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:15,836
Cigarette.

518
00:39:15,843 --> 00:39:16,852
Do that later.

519
00:39:17,764 --> 00:39:18,819
Commander Nie.

520
00:39:18,945 --> 00:39:20,926
Move Mr. Chairman to the bomb shelter on the stretcher

521
00:39:20,936 --> 00:39:21,826
Yes, sir

522
00:39:21,836 --> 00:39:23,769
Even if they start bombing,

523
00:39:23,788 --> 00:39:25,769
that doesn't mean they'll hit me

524
00:39:25,778 --> 00:39:26,941
I'm responsible for the Party

525
00:39:26,959 --> 00:39:27,943
I'm very lucky.

526
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:28,896
Hurry.

527
00:39:35,984 --> 00:39:38,760
Hurry.

528
00:39:38,936 --> 00:39:40,810
Hurry.

529
00:39:51,853 --> 00:39:53,846
Hurry.

530
00:39:59,857 --> 00:40:02,752
Hurry.

531
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,841
Hello...

532
00:40:06,852 --> 00:40:07,896
Well?

533
00:40:07,912 --> 00:40:08,943
Still can't get through.

534
00:40:10,904 --> 00:40:11,853
Keep trying.

535
00:40:11,864 --> 00:40:12,813
Yes, sir

536
00:40:13,815 --> 00:40:15,796
Telegram, sir.

537
00:40:19,928 --> 00:40:24,851
Massive bombings, casualties unknown.

538
00:40:48,915 --> 00:40:52,782
The food was still on the stove

539
00:40:52,797 --> 00:40:54,884
when the bombing started.

540
00:40:56,809 --> 00:41:00,961
Lao Guo said you have not eaten breakfast

541
00:41:04,914 --> 00:41:06,871
He ran back to the kitchen

542
00:42:23,938 --> 00:42:25,942
Telegram, Mr. Zhou

543
00:42:31,893 --> 00:42:32,912
Mr. Chairman,

544
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:36,008
we have very positive response for the May 1 slogan.

545
00:42:36,025 --> 00:42:38,955
The Parties have all signed their names.

546
00:42:38,966 --> 00:42:41,042
Already?

547
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:45,021
What a surprise.

548
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,932
The situation is becoming clear

549
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:49,981
The CDL and the Revolutionary Committee are on our side.

550
00:42:51,023 --> 00:42:54,867
Chiang is now completely isolated.

551
00:42:54,885 --> 00:42:58,076
Everything will fall into place

552
00:42:58,087 --> 00:42:59,082
It's time to call for a new CPPCC.

553
00:43:05,021 --> 00:43:08,935
Jishen, Mao wrote you personally.

554
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,921
What's your concern?

555
00:43:10,934 --> 00:43:14,991
Back in Fujian, we agreed to oppose Chiang.

556
00:43:15,007 --> 00:43:16,975
But they changed their minds

557
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:21,095
Fujian was a few years ago.

558
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:26,922
That was Bo Gu, not Mao.

559
00:43:26,933 --> 00:43:29,021
I'm not holding a grudge.

560
00:43:29,034 --> 00:43:31,988
I don't need another fall

561
00:43:32,886 --> 00:43:35,922
Chiang toyed with us for decades

562
00:43:35,938 --> 00:43:38,915
No doubt the CPC has better credibility,

563
00:43:38,929 --> 00:43:40,946
but what if...

564
00:43:40,961 --> 00:43:42,989
We just set up a new Party.

565
00:43:43,002 --> 00:43:46,027
As the Chairman of Revolutionary Committee of the KMT,

566
00:43:46,044 --> 00:43:48,985
I must do my best

567
00:43:48,995 --> 00:43:50,904
for the future of the Party

568
00:43:50,916 --> 00:43:54,048
Issue a separate declaration

569
00:43:54,058 --> 00:43:55,932
to oppose Chiang

570
00:43:55,949 --> 00:43:58,903
Reiterate our opposition against one-party autocracy.

571
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:01,105
That'll be our response to the CPC.

572
00:44:04,073 --> 00:44:05,888
Nowhere inside the Shanhai Pass

573
00:44:05,904 --> 00:44:08,098
is a suitable venue for the new consultative meeting,

574
00:44:08,116 --> 00:44:10,120
except Harbin

575
00:44:10,137 --> 00:44:12,070
It's far away,

576
00:44:12,078 --> 00:44:14,035
but at least it's a big city.

577
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,124
Feng Yuxiang will be home this month

578
00:44:18,142 --> 00:44:20,075
He'll go directly to the Northeast.

579
00:44:23,134 --> 00:44:25,127
Then let's settle for Harbin.

580
00:44:27,987 --> 00:44:30,098
To build a new government for the whole country

581
00:44:30,108 --> 00:44:33,097
without a decent big city,

582
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,932
it's just not adequate

583
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:39,038
Goods are scarce. Commodities entered the black market.

584
00:44:39,053 --> 00:44:41,105
Everyone is buying

585
00:44:41,115 --> 00:44:42,988
and selling short

586
00:44:42,996 --> 00:44:46,945
The top brass in the military and political circles

587
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:48,121
are behind these activities.

588
00:44:48,128 --> 00:44:49,990
Those profiteers

589
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,954
defy government orders.

590
00:44:52,961 --> 00:44:56,033
Mr. Weng can't hold the fort much longer.

591
00:44:59,124 --> 00:45:02,054
What's your solution?

592
00:45:07,029 --> 00:45:09,924
I don't want your complaints.

593
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,019
I want a solution.

594
00:45:11,031 --> 00:45:13,083
As the financial center in the Far East,

595
00:45:13,092 --> 00:45:15,987
Shanghai is the key.

596
00:45:15,993 --> 00:45:17,938
If we can stabilize the market in Shanghai,

597
00:45:17,955 --> 00:45:20,042
the rest of the country will fall in line.

598
00:45:22,007 --> 00:45:23,097
I must go to Shanghai.

599
00:45:37,699 --> 00:45:39,775
Master Chiang, on behalf of Shanghai,

600
00:45:39,783 --> 00:45:43,591
we're hosting a banquet for you at the Jinjiang Hotel.

601
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:45,671
I'll pick you up later

602
00:45:46,731 --> 00:45:48,807
Tell everyone on the Special Commando Unit

603
00:45:48,815 --> 00:45:52,788
to meet in my office in half an hour,

604
00:45:55,654 --> 00:45:57,646
including you

605
00:46:02,742 --> 00:46:05,684
In preparing for the new CPPCC,

606
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:08,697
the CPC is open for suggestions.

607
00:46:08,711 --> 00:46:11,605
They don't intend to run the whole show.

608
00:46:11,614 --> 00:46:14,734
They do things differently from the Nanjing government

609
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,622
What about Zhang Lan?

610
00:46:17,632 --> 00:46:20,835
He's always for building the state via CPPCC

611
00:46:26,734 --> 00:46:29,735
They already have a well thought-out plan

612
00:46:29,747 --> 00:46:33,792
to escort you and my mother up north.

613
00:46:34,684 --> 00:46:38,647
Mao invited you and Li Jishen up north

614
00:46:38,659 --> 00:46:41,696
to discuss re-opening the CPPCC.

615
00:46:41,713 --> 00:46:43,706
When is Li Jishen leaving?

616
00:46:44,687 --> 00:46:45,742
Don't know yet

617
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:49,778
What's your answer?

618
00:46:53,779 --> 00:46:56,755
I have decided

619
00:46:57,874 --> 00:46:59,713
to stay put

620
00:47:00,698 --> 00:47:01,718
But...

621
00:47:01,729 --> 00:47:05,881
Let Shen Junru liaise with the CPC on behalf of the CDL

622
00:47:08,908 --> 00:47:11,885
When are you leaving?

623
00:47:14,857 --> 00:47:20,907
I'm too old and sick.

624
00:47:21,845 --> 00:47:27,930
Besides, Chiang won't let me go that easily.

625
00:47:28,905 --> 00:47:33,816
How can you not show for something this important?

626
00:47:33,831 --> 00:47:36,797
I'm putting Shen Junru in charge.

627
00:47:37,816 --> 00:47:43,795
I am Chinese.

628
00:47:43,805 --> 00:47:45,868
Is that right, Father?

629
00:47:47,749 --> 00:47:48,935
One stroke is missing.

630
00:47:50,773 --> 00:47:52,849
Isn't this pretty, Uncle Mao?

631
00:47:52,866 --> 00:47:56,756
Yes, but you can't eat everything.

632
00:47:56,901 --> 00:47:58,977
Mr. Chairman, it's time for the meeting.

633
00:47:58,984 --> 00:48:00,953
Let's go back

634
00:48:00,967 --> 00:48:02,781
Will you carry me, Uncle Mao?

635
00:48:02,819 --> 00:48:03,958
Carry me, Father.

636
00:48:03,971 --> 00:48:05,857
Will you carry me, Uncle Mao? Father

637
00:48:05,872 --> 00:48:07,817
Liya, do you want me to carry you?

638
00:48:07,836 --> 00:48:08,785
Yes.

639
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:11,790
Let's go.

640
00:48:13,773 --> 00:48:15,909
Any news, Enlai?

641
00:48:15,916 --> 00:48:18,928
Chiang's economic reform is a deadlock.

642
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:20,944
Chiang Ching-kuo personally flew to Shanghai.

643
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:25,840
But the Bund is entrenched with powerful factions.

644
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:27,876
It's a labyrinth within the KMT.

645
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,958
Chiang's son won't accomplish anything.

646
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:34,856
Liya, let's play piggyback.

647
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:35,013
Yes.

648
00:48:35,031 --> 00:48:36,940
Let's go.

649
00:49:01,836 --> 00:49:02,974
No one should doubt the Government's

650
00:49:02,988 --> 00:49:05,859
determination to implement financial reforms.

651
00:49:06,021 --> 00:49:07,848
In face of a national crisis,

652
00:49:07,864 --> 00:49:10,035
anyone who compromises the nation's interest

653
00:49:10,047 --> 00:49:11,992
is a traitor

654
00:49:12,009 --> 00:49:14,014
and an enemy of the KMT

655
00:49:14,903 --> 00:49:18,877
I urge the elite of the business sector

656
00:49:18,888 --> 00:49:21,854
and prominent individuals of society to work with us

657
00:49:21,862 --> 00:49:24,020
to restore financial order and stabilize prices

658
00:49:24,035 --> 00:49:26,930
in the shortest time possible

659
00:49:26,939 --> 00:49:30,059
and do your best to save our country.

660
00:49:30,072 --> 00:49:31,068
Mr. Chiang

661
00:49:31,084 --> 00:49:33,895
Will you be fair?

662
00:49:33,907 --> 00:49:35,889
What about those offenders who have influence?

663
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:36,944
How will you handle them?

664
00:49:40,106 --> 00:49:41,945
My mission in Shanghai

665
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,917
is to hunt tigers, not squat mosquitoes.

666
00:49:45,933 --> 00:49:46,977
Mr. Chiang, can you tell us

667
00:49:46,994 --> 00:49:48,939
your concrete course of action?

668
00:49:49,948 --> 00:49:53,887
Tigers are easy to hunt

669
00:49:53,903 --> 00:49:58,898
but I'm afraid icebergs

670
00:49:58,911 --> 00:50:01,046
are hard to remove.

671
00:50:12,007 --> 00:50:13,110
You are...

672
00:50:16,934 --> 00:50:20,978
Du Yuesheng

673
00:50:25,165 --> 00:50:30,978
Mr. Du, I'm all ears

674
00:50:30,993 --> 00:50:36,010
My son Weiping has been arrested

675
00:50:38,061 --> 00:50:42,118
If he broke the law, I have no complaints,

676
00:50:43,108 --> 00:50:47,984
but someone else in Shanghai

677
00:50:47,994 --> 00:50:51,090
is hoarding supplies

678
00:50:51,109 --> 00:50:53,185
and peddling them to the black market for profits,

679
00:50:53,191 --> 00:50:57,189
openly defying the law

680
00:50:57,206 --> 00:51:02,141
If you choose to overlook this,

681
00:51:02,153 --> 00:51:06,210
President Chiang will be very disappointed.

682
00:51:08,161 --> 00:51:11,150
Please point me in the right direction, Mr. Du.

683
00:51:13,127 --> 00:51:17,208
I will look into it.

684
00:51:26,164 --> 00:51:27,220
Read it.

685
00:51:29,238 --> 00:51:32,097
7 godowns along the Bund.

686
00:51:32,112 --> 00:51:34,164
The godown on No. 36 Nanjing Road.

687
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:38,042
No 17 Avenue Joffre.

688
00:51:38,049 --> 00:51:41,145
12 godowns in the South Market using the word "Jia"

689
00:51:43,246 --> 00:51:46,152
Mr. Chiang,

690
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:50,037
this is the real tiger.

691
00:51:55,293 --> 00:51:57,060
Who is it?

692
00:52:05,165 --> 00:52:10,254
Yangtze Company owned by the Kung's.

693
00:52:19,233 --> 00:52:24,096
Wire Wei Lihuang, urge him to pull back south.

694
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:26,245
With crack troops like these,

695
00:52:26,253 --> 00:52:30,179
even if we lose the Northeast, we can get it back easily.

696
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:34,173
President, we wired him several times

697
00:52:34,182 --> 00:52:35,286
urging him to go south,

698
00:52:35,294 --> 00:52:37,334
but he ignored us.

699
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,209
Get my plane ready,

700
00:52:40,221 --> 00:52:42,119
I'II fly out to Shenyang

701
00:52:42,133 --> 00:52:42,215
Yes.

702
00:52:42,263 --> 00:52:44,137
The President

703
00:53:06,254 --> 00:53:07,333
What is it?

704
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,355
Feng Yuxiang is dead.

705
00:53:34,201 --> 00:53:34,391
Chairman.

706
00:53:39,408 --> 00:53:43,228
What happened to you?

707
00:53:44,204 --> 00:53:48,237
You bragged about your abilities.

708
00:53:48,249 --> 00:53:50,230
You bragged about Shanghai.

709
00:53:50,242 --> 00:53:52,424
You bragged about the Red Army. And now?

710
00:53:52,435 --> 00:53:56,290
General Feng was burned to death.

711
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,269
You.

712
00:53:58,282 --> 00:54:02,209
This is all you can do

713
00:54:12,421 --> 00:54:16,407
Think it over. You won't get away.

714
00:54:16,416 --> 00:54:19,417
You'll be executed if you lose a battle.

715
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:22,253
Now something went wrong on your front.

716
00:54:22,263 --> 00:54:25,288
Tell me what you should do. Speak up.

717
00:54:25,298 --> 00:54:27,350
KMT secret agents did it?

718
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,364
According to the Russians,

719
00:54:29,373 --> 00:54:31,449
General Feng was watching a film in his cabin.

720
00:54:31,465 --> 00:54:34,288
The film caught on fire and ignited the cabin.

721
00:54:34,299 --> 00:54:37,312
The film caught on fire? He's a general.

722
00:54:37,323 --> 00:54:39,292
Why didn't he run?

723
00:54:39,305 --> 00:54:42,295
What a bunch of morons.

724
00:54:43,371 --> 00:54:47,464
A man is dead, the Russians need to blame someone.

725
00:54:48,478 --> 00:54:52,369
The ship was out at sea and abroad.

726
00:54:52,383 --> 00:54:55,289
We didn't get all the facts

727
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:03,310
General Feng became a soldier at 12.

728
00:55:03,327 --> 00:55:06,531
50 years in the battlefield didn't kill him

729
00:55:07,443 --> 00:55:10,349
But our invitation

730
00:55:10,367 --> 00:55:13,403
to send him abroad buried him at sea

731
00:55:15,514 --> 00:55:17,447
I feel so guilty

732
00:55:18,337 --> 00:55:22,525
General Feng may be dead

733
00:55:22,532 --> 00:55:25,498
but he left behind a legacy

734
00:55:25,516 --> 00:55:27,509
to build a new, independent China.

735
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:33,466
Enlai, wire our condolences to Madame Feng

736
00:55:33,476 --> 00:55:35,552
and invite her to the CPPCC.

737
00:55:35,569 --> 00:55:37,360
Yes.

738
00:55:37,372 --> 00:55:40,539
Mr. Chairman, it has been suggested

739
00:55:40,555 --> 00:55:43,366
that the CPPCC should act for the NPC

740
00:55:43,379 --> 00:55:45,360
to elect the central government

741
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:51,572
A general election is hard to come by during the war

742
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:56,548
We must consult all the other Parties on this

743
00:55:57,448 --> 00:55:59,571
Let's not waste any time.

744
00:55:59,581 --> 00:56:03,459
Form the coalition government first, then call the NPC,

745
00:56:03,475 --> 00:56:04,578
is that it?

746
00:56:04,597 --> 00:56:05,593
Precisely

747
00:56:08,412 --> 00:56:10,619
They're still in a war

748
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:14,552
They can't elect their delegates

749
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,419
We should make allowances for that.

750
00:56:17,434 --> 00:56:20,554
I'll get in touch with Shen Junru

751
00:56:20,568 --> 00:56:22,490
and pass on your message.

752
00:56:23,622 --> 00:56:28,569
Mr. Mao and Mr. Zhou invited you up north again

753
00:56:34,596 --> 00:56:35,640
Assemble.

754
00:56:36,619 --> 00:56:38,433
Hurry.

755
00:56:43,658 --> 00:56:48,640
Search all the godowns, buildings, apartments and villas

756
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:52,652
in Shanghai owned by Yangtze Company and the Kung's.

757
00:56:54,492 --> 00:56:59,522
Operation starts at 7 am tomorrow morning, understand?

758
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:24,626
Mr. Chairman.

759
00:57:25,573 --> 00:57:29,523
Voices within the US government have indicated

760
00:57:29,538 --> 00:57:31,614
they will support your replacement of Mr. Chiang.

761
00:57:31,631 --> 00:57:33,707
What do you think?

762
00:57:36,577 --> 00:57:40,598
Whether they support me or Chiang,

763
00:57:40,612 --> 00:57:44,610
it's a cheap trick to pit Chinese against Chinese

764
00:57:44,618 --> 00:57:47,630
If the US wishes to maintain diplomatic relations with the future China,

765
00:57:47,642 --> 00:57:50,536
ignoring the CPC

766
00:57:50,545 --> 00:57:52,716
is unrealistic.

767
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:55,564
The second question.

768
00:57:55,572 --> 00:57:58,667
If Vice President Li replaced President Chiang,

769
00:57:58,756 --> 00:58:01,710
will things get better?

770
00:58:04,614 --> 00:58:05,645
In terms of warfare,

771
00:58:06,626 --> 00:58:09,722
Bai Chongxi is quite capable.

772
00:58:10,742 --> 00:58:12,616
In terms of politics,

773
00:58:12,764 --> 00:58:17,591
Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi together are no match for Chiang.

774
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:21,779
You did not answer my question, sir.

775
00:59:06,784 --> 00:59:07,756
Here

776
00:59:30,886 --> 00:59:34,824
What are you looking at?

777
00:59:34,841 --> 00:59:35,836
Jinzhou.

778
00:59:37,665 --> 00:59:38,886
That's over 1,000 km away.

779
00:59:38,897 --> 00:59:41,874
More definite news won't arrive until tomorrow.

780
00:59:44,804 --> 00:59:47,769
It's already 10:30 and yet no sign of attack. Which division was it?

781
00:59:47,788 --> 00:59:51,678
The 8th column.

782
00:59:51,693 --> 00:59:53,697
You asked me 5 times already

783
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:55,818
Really?

784
00:59:58,693 --> 01:00:02,785
The Battle of Jinzhou is not just over a city or a region

785
01:00:02,798 --> 01:00:04,885
If we win, we can go on

786
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:09,716
If we lose, the situation gets complicated

787
01:00:14,793 --> 01:00:18,826
With regards to the draft agenda of the CPPCC,

788
01:00:18,839 --> 01:00:22,837
Zhang Lan and Shen Junru made minor changes

789
01:00:23,805 --> 01:00:27,767
They know we're at war.

790
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:30,769
They're being very understanding.

791
01:00:31,906 --> 01:00:33,792
Zhang Lan is sick.

792
01:00:33,808 --> 01:00:36,833
We should postpone his trip up north

793
01:00:38,774 --> 01:00:42,902
We must invite him.

794
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,838
But we'll let him decide

795
01:00:45,853 --> 01:00:47,952
when to come.

796
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:50,973
We'll wait.

797
01:00:55,977 --> 01:00:59,832
Aunt, he has full authority

798
01:00:59,842 --> 01:01:02,938
to seize everything owned by the Yangtze Company

799
01:01:02,956 --> 01:01:05,815
He put out word all over Shanghai looking for me

800
01:01:06,791 --> 01:01:09,780
Now I finally see him.

801
01:01:09,795 --> 01:01:11,930
That ought to save him some trouble.

802
01:01:12,195 --> 01:01:14,930
Have you gone mad, David?

803
01:01:14,992 --> 01:01:20,900
Relax. He's the Liaison Administrator, the prince.

804
01:01:20,909 --> 01:01:23,815
I wouldn't dare shoot the prince.

805
01:01:24,894 --> 01:01:26,970
This is very simple, cousin.

806
01:01:26,987 --> 01:01:29,798
Shoot me and it's all over

807
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,836
With the culprit dead, you'll be famous in Shanghai.

808
01:01:32,845 --> 01:01:34,968
We'll both get what we want.

809
01:01:38,823 --> 01:01:39,867
Ching-kuo.

810
01:01:46,012 --> 01:01:48,954
It's clearly written in the state papers.

811
01:01:48,966 --> 01:01:52,038
You're needed for questioning within 10 days

812
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:54,018
or you'll be severely punished.

813
01:01:54,033 --> 01:01:56,939
7 days have gone by, you decide what to do next

814
01:01:57,938 --> 01:01:59,895
Yangtze Company is our family estate.

815
01:01:59,911 --> 01:02:01,014
I dare you to arrest my father.

816
01:02:01,032 --> 01:02:03,902
Nonsense. It's clearly your fault

817
01:02:03,916 --> 01:02:05,860
Leave your father out of this

818
01:02:06,940 --> 01:02:09,964
If he and Ai-ling found out about your monkey business,

819
01:02:09,974 --> 01:02:11,896
they won't spare you

820
01:02:12,056 --> 01:02:14,986
This is how we do business in Shanghai.

821
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,859
But the arrival of a Liaison Administrator changed all that

822
01:02:18,875 --> 01:02:22,055
Auntie, everyone does it. That's the rule

823
01:02:22,069 --> 01:02:24,026
Only a feudalistic dictator

824
01:02:24,042 --> 01:02:26,070
would run a business without rules.

825
01:02:27,016 --> 01:02:28,973
Who are you calling a dictator?

826
01:02:35,937 --> 01:02:39,947
The government is fighting a war and soldiers are dying on the front

827
01:02:39,962 --> 01:02:43,960
But the state treasury is empty and we had to borrow from the Americans.

828
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:46,007
Currency has depreciated and prices have skyrocketed.

829
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:48,013
People are running scared.

830
01:02:49,044 --> 01:02:50,953
But inside your godowns,

831
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:53,043
you hoarded over 100 thousand tons of supplies

832
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,922
which you are unwilling to sell.

833
01:02:56,003 --> 01:02:58,139
I'm a businessman, not a philanthropist

834
01:02:59,077 --> 01:03:02,019
The CPC is working on land reforms and political consultation.

835
01:03:03,132 --> 01:03:06,145
Even Cai Tingkai and Shen Junru have left for the Northeast.

836
01:03:06,156 --> 01:03:10,118
Mao is setting up his own government.

837
01:03:15,129 --> 01:03:19,980
Madame, you've always supported Father.

838
01:03:19,995 --> 01:03:22,142
I bet you never expected

839
01:03:22,158 --> 01:03:27,116
right here in Shanghai,

840
01:03:31,049 --> 01:03:34,050
someone is undermining him,

841
01:03:34,063 --> 01:03:37,966
destroying the foundation of this country.

842
01:03:37,979 --> 01:03:40,161
Their fortune, apartments,

843
01:03:40,171 --> 01:03:44,976
clothes, perfumes and iceboxes are like a virus

844
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:48,107
residing on the mere skeleton of this country.

845
01:03:49,132 --> 01:03:53,190
They are the enemy, Father's and the state's

846
01:03:53,198 --> 01:03:56,128
That's enough,

847
01:03:58,064 --> 01:04:00,128
Ching-kuo.

848
01:04:00,137 --> 01:04:03,174
There are no enemies here, only family.

849
01:04:05,213 --> 01:04:12,236
Let's talk about family today.

850
01:04:15,953 --> 01:04:17,946
I'm not in the position to say anything

851
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:21,838
He Yingqin is the Director of National Defense

852
01:04:21,848 --> 01:04:24,944
Take pains to stay save. Let Chiang talk to him.

853
01:04:29,936 --> 01:04:32,890
You're a better marksman than He Yingqin.

854
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:35,924
So what?

855
01:04:36,922 --> 01:04:39,911
Chiang owns China now.

856
01:04:39,925 --> 01:04:43,947
Even this gun has his name engraved on it

857
01:04:43,958 --> 01:04:45,927
What can we do about it?

858
01:04:48,072 --> 01:04:53,956
The CPC troops use this type of rifle too.

859
01:04:53,967 --> 01:04:56,921
What matters is not the name on the rifle,

860
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:58,054
but the man who uses it

861
01:05:02,995 --> 01:05:04,893
Holding a rifle

862
01:05:04,907 --> 01:05:08,892
beats holding an empty title of Director of National Defense

863
01:05:11,012 --> 01:05:15,923
If you're the President,

864
01:05:15,937 --> 01:05:17,976
will the Americans back us up?

865
01:05:22,993 --> 01:05:25,958
Stuart dropped a hint.

866
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:36,027
Then let's get rid of Chiang.

867
01:05:36,045 --> 01:05:38,026
It's still too early to say.

868
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:45,094
Never too early to take precautions.

869
01:05:45,103 --> 01:05:47,962
It's time we get started

870
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:59,005
Ching-kuo, Madam is leaving for the US tomorrow

871
01:06:00,936 --> 01:06:04,056
to ask President Truman for help.

872
01:06:05,110 --> 01:06:08,064
The situation in the Northeast is deteriorating quickly.

873
01:06:09,054 --> 01:06:11,995
We need help from the Americans

874
01:06:13,968 --> 01:06:16,115
I flew back from the Northeast

875
01:06:17,061 --> 01:06:19,029
just to tell you,

876
01:06:21,014 --> 01:06:23,078
at a time like this

877
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:29,151
we can't afford a fire in the backyard.

878
01:06:29,161 --> 01:06:31,961
Father

879
01:06:32,094 --> 01:06:36,057
If we don't punish the Kung's,

880
01:06:36,067 --> 01:06:39,009
the economy in Shanghai is doomed.

881
01:06:42,132 --> 01:06:44,979
I absolutely understand

882
01:06:46,086 --> 01:06:50,974
The corruption of the KMT is in the bones.

883
01:06:52,182 --> 01:06:55,088
It's not just the problem of the Kung's

884
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:59,111
Crackdown on corruption is a major issue

885
01:06:59,128 --> 01:07:04,003
Timing and extent are crucial...

886
01:07:04,022 --> 01:07:05,148
it's tough.

887
01:07:06,204 --> 01:07:09,158
You lose the Party if you proceed.

888
01:07:09,176 --> 01:07:13,031
You lose the country if you don't.

889
01:07:16,133 --> 01:07:18,007
It's tough.

890
01:07:19,106 --> 01:07:21,087
Father

891
01:07:21,097 --> 01:07:26,033
Both the Party and the country are on the brink of disaster.

892
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:28,100
Alright

893
01:07:34,158 --> 01:07:36,127
The matter at hand

894
01:07:38,052 --> 01:07:42,097
is to move the troops up North to south of the Yangtze River

895
01:07:43,066 --> 01:07:45,118
to ensure the safety there

896
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:49,195
Going after the Kung's

897
01:07:49,212 --> 01:07:52,154
is meaningless now.

898
01:08:00,031 --> 01:08:04,148
Zhang Lan is truly a saint of Sichuan.

899
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:06,028
He deserves it.

900
01:08:07,138 --> 01:08:11,218
Without him at the CPPCC,

901
01:08:11,232 --> 01:08:14,209
none of us Sichuanese

902
01:08:14,225 --> 01:08:17,179
would dare to go.

903
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:21,188
The Northeast is too cold for a man his age.

904
01:08:22,221 --> 01:08:25,056
He probably can't make it

905
01:08:25,064 --> 01:08:27,045
If anything happens to him...

906
01:08:29,077 --> 01:08:30,192
What about Beiping?

907
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:32,189
What?

908
01:08:34,172 --> 01:08:36,176
Postpone the meeting till next year.

909
01:08:36,193 --> 01:08:39,147
Move the venue to Beiping

910
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:40,200
It's possible.

911
01:08:40,207 --> 01:08:44,264
The troops are tired after taking Shenyang.

912
01:08:44,281 --> 01:08:46,238
Fu Zuoyi commands 600,000 men.

913
01:08:46,252 --> 01:08:48,139
Relying on 2 divisions in the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region

914
01:08:48,154 --> 01:08:51,049
to capture Beiping is impossible.

915
01:08:51,067 --> 01:08:52,276
According to our intelligence

916
01:08:52,288 --> 01:08:55,123
lately, Fu Zuoyi is having second thoughts.

917
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:57,145
After the failed attempt on Shijiazhuang,

918
01:08:57,162 --> 01:09:00,057
he seems willing to negotiate

919
01:09:01,076 --> 01:09:03,139
Send someone reliable to liaise with him.

920
01:09:03,158 --> 01:09:04,130
Ok.

921
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:10,171
It'd be heavenly, if we can liberate Beiping peacefully.

922
01:09:10,184 --> 01:09:13,114
Fu's daughter Dongju is a Party member.

923
01:09:13,126 --> 01:09:14,276
She's perfect for the job

924
01:09:14,288 --> 01:09:15,284
Yes.

925
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:20,224
In that case, I'll be the dictator for a change.

926
01:09:21,144 --> 01:09:24,275
Ask the Northeast Field Army to enter the Shanhai Pass within 7 days.

927
01:09:24,286 --> 01:09:26,160
Tell Lin Biao

928
01:09:26,178 --> 01:09:28,194
this is an order and not a probe.

929
01:09:32,324 --> 01:09:36,250
It'll take a few days to gather up the troops

930
01:09:36,257 --> 01:09:40,219
and each column needs time to adjust otherwise.

931
01:09:40,230 --> 01:09:43,220
Moving inside the Pass will be a problem.

932
01:09:43,232 --> 01:09:48,203
The cadres don't want to make the move

933
01:09:48,218 --> 01:09:51,289
and it'll take time for deployment.

934
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:56,175
The deadline on the 22nd is too tight.

935
01:09:58,136 --> 01:10:03,166
Wire this back: Received order dispatched on 18th at 18:00

936
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:07,190
Will set out on the 22nd as instructed.

937
01:10:08,255 --> 01:10:12,264
Details to follow Signed, Lin, Luo & Liu

938
01:10:39,222 --> 01:10:42,306
You should think for yourself too.

939
01:10:44,227 --> 01:10:46,145
You really want me

940
01:10:46,145 --> 01:10:49,182
to hold the horsewhip for your Chairman?

941
01:10:51,234 --> 01:10:55,238
Forget it, Father It was a joke.

942
01:10:55,238 --> 01:10:56,239
A joke?

943
01:10:56,239 --> 01:10:58,366
I personally told the American reporter.

944
01:10:58,366 --> 01:11:01,244
It's not a joke.

945
01:11:01,244 --> 01:11:03,201
That's because you took it to heart

946
01:11:06,249 --> 01:11:10,253
Li Jishen is a founding member of the Party who opposes Chiang openly

947
01:11:10,253 --> 01:11:11,166
Over these last few months,

948
01:11:11,254 --> 01:11:14,340
Mao has repeatedly invited him up north.

949
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:18,124
He's been stalling him. He's bewildered by

950
01:11:24,267 --> 01:11:25,346
You come to see me

951
01:11:28,396 --> 01:11:32,180
with a 18-year old newspaper.

952
01:11:33,401 --> 01:11:35,403
How kind of you.

953
01:11:35,403 --> 01:11:38,108
The quarrel between you and the President

954
01:11:38,197 --> 01:11:41,151
should stay within the Party.

955
01:11:41,242 --> 01:11:43,318
Between you and the CPC,

956
01:11:44,245 --> 01:11:48,373
don't forget you ordered the execution of Cai Hesen.

957
01:11:54,297 --> 01:11:55,293
What are you saying?

958
01:11:57,258 --> 01:12:01,387
Return to Nanjing and pick any job you want,

959
01:12:01,387 --> 01:12:03,306
as long as you don't join the CPC

960
01:12:03,306 --> 01:12:05,263
A promotion for a promise?

961
01:12:09,312 --> 01:12:13,144
You think I'll go?

962
01:12:13,232 --> 01:12:17,236
Before I came, Vice President Li told me

963
01:12:17,236 --> 01:12:21,186
he would like to liaise with the CPC through you.

964
01:12:22,450 --> 01:12:26,317
Any condition is negotiable,

965
01:12:28,414 --> 01:12:33,242
including using the Yangtze as a partition.

966
01:12:39,342 --> 01:12:41,169
Use the Yangtze as a partition

967
01:12:43,304 --> 01:12:45,213
and split up China?

968
01:12:45,431 --> 01:12:47,391
Tell Li Zongren

969
01:12:47,391 --> 01:12:51,259
The infamy is more than he can handle.

970
01:13:22,468 --> 01:13:23,382
Hello, Mr President

971
01:13:24,345 --> 01:13:25,341
Commander Fu.

972
01:13:29,392 --> 01:13:33,521
Our troops can pull back to Tanggu and Zhangjiakou

973
01:13:33,521 --> 01:13:35,398
I can't guarantee we'll win

974
01:13:35,398 --> 01:13:37,390
But we're perfectly capable of defense.

975
01:13:39,485 --> 01:13:42,272
With the big picture in mind.

976
01:13:42,363 --> 01:13:47,493
I intend to move 600,000 men to Jiangnan

977
01:13:47,493 --> 01:13:52,369
I can be more flexible in both defense and offense

978
01:13:52,457 --> 01:13:54,417
That's containing our sovereignty to the southeast.

979
01:13:54,417 --> 01:13:57,371
As the old capital, Beiping has political significance.

980
01:13:57,462 --> 01:13:59,371
Giving it up

981
01:14:00,423 --> 01:14:03,424
is unfavorable to our government internationally

982
01:14:08,389 --> 01:14:14,427
You're right. International scope is the situation.

983
01:14:39,545 --> 01:14:41,372
Wait.

984
01:14:46,344 --> 01:14:50,507
What is it, Father?

985
01:14:55,436 --> 01:14:58,307
Who's your commanding officer?

986
01:15:01,484 --> 01:15:05,316
We agreed not to discuss that

987
01:15:05,613 --> 01:15:09,492
I wish to talk to them.

988
01:15:09,492 --> 01:15:12,327
About what? The horsewhip?

989
01:15:12,412 --> 01:15:16,541
What I'm telling you now

990
01:15:16,541 --> 01:15:19,542
will determine the lives of millions.

991
01:15:23,464 --> 01:15:25,373
I understand

992
01:15:53,453 --> 01:15:55,576
She's so hot.

993
01:15:58,499 --> 01:15:59,542
I'm sorry, May-ling.

994
01:15:59,542 --> 01:16:01,586
Both the House and the Congress

995
01:16:01,586 --> 01:16:05,453
have refused your request to make another speech.

996
01:16:06,466 --> 01:16:10,470
But the Government will still support the General as before

997
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:14,514
with the hope that the civil war does not continue any longer in China.

998
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:20,513
President Truman and his administration is concentrating on Europe.

999
01:16:21,564 --> 01:16:24,399
But the East needs a revival too.

1000
01:16:26,527 --> 01:16:27,570
My friend.

1001
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:30,441
China should have been included in your plan.

1002
01:16:30,615 --> 01:16:33,618
Any loans and assistance from the US now

1003
01:16:33,618 --> 01:16:37,580
should be spent on security and constructive activities,

1004
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:38,576
not war

1005
01:16:39,499 --> 01:16:44,504
You got 400 million dollars from the original loan.

1006
01:16:44,504 --> 01:16:45,671
That's still in existence.

1007
01:16:45,671 --> 01:16:47,673
We both know there's only a few million dollars left.

1008
01:16:47,673 --> 01:16:50,627
And it's not enough to support my husband's administration

1009
01:16:50,718 --> 01:16:52,627
and his life's work.

1010
01:16:54,639 --> 01:16:57,474
Mr. Secretary of State,

1011
01:16:57,558 --> 01:17:00,561
we need your additional assistance,

1012
01:17:00,561 --> 01:17:01,646
please.

1013
01:17:01,646 --> 01:17:04,647
Madam, there's nothing more we can do.

1014
01:18:39,577 --> 01:18:40,692
New Year is coming up.

1015
01:18:42,663 --> 01:18:47,658
Make this announcement at month end.

1016
01:18:47,752 --> 01:18:49,626
About what?

1017
01:18:49,712 --> 01:18:53,710
If they want me to resign, I'll resign.

1018
01:18:54,592 --> 01:18:55,718
You can't do that, Mr. President.

1019
01:18:55,718 --> 01:18:57,675
It's not my choice.

1020
01:18:58,721 --> 01:19:01,675
But someone within our Party wants me out.

1021
01:19:11,651 --> 01:19:15,738
You repeatedly rejected Mao and Zhou's invitation.

1022
01:19:15,738 --> 01:19:18,783
You're too arrogant.

1023
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:21,619
That's an overstatement, Madame Liao.

1024
01:19:21,619 --> 01:19:23,612
I'm tied up at home

1025
01:19:23,704 --> 01:19:26,741
And I'm also busy with military affairs

1026
01:19:26,833 --> 01:19:30,670
Preparations for the new CPPCC are moving along and days are counting.

1027
01:19:30,670 --> 01:19:35,633
After decades, the KMT can't be absent

1028
01:19:35,633 --> 01:19:37,626
You're still hesitant about going.

1029
01:19:37,718 --> 01:19:41,681
You expect Mao to fly to Nanjing to invite Chiang?

1030
01:19:41,681 --> 01:19:44,642
We're definitely not inviting him.

1031
01:19:44,642 --> 01:19:46,682
He's a war criminal, a murderer.

1032
01:19:47,687 --> 01:19:50,807
We can't have a CPPCC without the KMT.

1033
01:19:51,858 --> 01:19:56,566
Jishen, Chairman Mao said

1034
01:19:56,654 --> 01:19:58,647
he'd wait for you in Beiping.

1035
01:20:16,716 --> 01:20:18,792
Chief, some landlord's compound up ahead

1036
01:20:18,885 --> 01:20:20,845
The wall is too high for us to climb over.

1037
01:20:20,845 --> 01:20:24,712
Grenades won't blow it apart. Please send for the artillery.

1038
01:20:34,776 --> 01:20:35,689
Flare

1039
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:37,651
Flare

1040
01:21:00,718 --> 01:21:03,805
Commander...

1041
01:21:03,805 --> 01:21:06,805
we have reached Beiping city

1042
01:21:13,773 --> 01:21:16,943
2 pieces of good news, sir

1043
01:21:16,943 --> 01:21:17,902
First,

1044
01:21:17,902 --> 01:21:21,734
Li Jishen, Shen Yanbing and Zhang Naiqi

1045
01:21:21,823 --> 01:21:22,907
left 4 days ago.

1046
01:21:22,907 --> 01:21:26,774
They boarded the Aldan and will disembark at Dalian day after tomorrow.

1047
01:21:27,829 --> 01:21:31,778
And the other one?

1048
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:35,662
Chiang Kai-shek resigned

1049
01:21:48,766 --> 01:21:49,851
Mr. Ambassador.

1050
01:21:49,851 --> 01:21:51,853
As China's ally,

1051
01:21:51,853 --> 01:21:55,897
why is the US doing nothing at a time like this?

1052
01:21:59,861 --> 01:22:03,858
God help those who help themselves, my friend

1053
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:11,873
I think Chiang is giving Li Zongren a hard time.

1054
01:22:11,873 --> 01:22:16,794
He knows Li wants to negotiate, so he brought it up first.

1055
01:22:16,794 --> 01:22:21,799
He doesn't want Li to get the credit

1056
01:22:21,799 --> 01:22:24,884
and he wants to give us a hard time.

1057
01:22:25,887 --> 01:22:29,974
He already stepped down, but he had to pull a stunt like this.

1058
01:22:29,974 --> 01:22:31,851
After this,

1059
01:22:31,851 --> 01:22:35,772
it would be tough for Li to talk to us.

1060
01:22:35,772 --> 01:22:36,898
The CDL and the other Parties

1061
01:22:36,898 --> 01:22:39,942
have yet to make a stand, they're waiting to see.

1062
01:22:39,942 --> 01:22:40,985
In my opinion,

1063
01:22:40,985 --> 01:22:42,776
deep down

1064
01:22:42,862 --> 01:22:44,771
they want us to talk.

1065
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:47,948
Li Zongren wants peace, we want peace,

1066
01:22:48,034 --> 01:22:50,870
the other Parties want peace.

1067
01:22:50,870 --> 01:22:53,998
We'll do the Acting President a favor

1068
01:22:53,998 --> 01:22:55,875
Great.

1069
01:22:55,875 --> 01:22:58,920
Let's give him a chance to talk,

1070
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:02,752
but we decide how.

1071
01:23:23,986 --> 01:23:28,981
Victory bulletin...

1072
01:23:31,953 --> 01:23:33,826
War communique from Huaihai

1073
01:23:37,875 --> 01:23:39,043
According to the wire,

1074
01:23:39,043 --> 01:23:42,792
550,000 enemies were killed and Du Yuming was captured.

1075
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:44,919
What about the New 5th and the 18th?

1076
01:23:45,007 --> 01:23:46,008
Gone.

1077
01:23:46,052 --> 01:23:48,940
The 5 major divisions were wiped out.

1078
01:23:49,012 --> 01:23:51,801
Chiang is finished for good.

1079
01:23:58,938 --> 01:24:02,983
There'll be no more fighting north of the Yangtze.

1080
01:24:25,965 --> 01:24:28,836
Cheers.

1081
01:24:59,832 --> 01:25:05,004
This is the last battle.

1082
01:25:05,004 --> 01:25:10,885
We stay united till tomorrow.

1083
01:25:10,885 --> 01:25:16,970
Internationale

1084
01:25:17,058 --> 01:25:22,980
will come true.

1085
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:28,986
This is the last battle.

1086
01:25:28,986 --> 01:25:34,951
We stay united till tomorrow.

1087
01:25:34,951 --> 01:25:47,870
"Internationale" will come true.

1088
01:27:13,966 --> 01:27:19,969
Father, it's cold on the ground.

1089
01:27:24,018 --> 01:27:25,845
Sit down.

1090
01:27:31,943 --> 01:27:33,022
Ching-kuo.

1091
01:27:34,028 --> 01:27:39,864
You did a good job in Shanghai. I'm very pleased.

1092
01:27:46,916 --> 01:27:50,783
I made Chen Cheng Governor of Taiwan.

1093
01:27:51,879 --> 01:27:53,919
Do you know why?

1094
01:27:56,050 --> 01:27:59,799
Your route of retreat?

1095
01:28:00,930 --> 01:28:07,015
Yes, Du Yuming's men were wiped out.

1096
01:28:07,103 --> 01:28:10,940
I lost all the men who can fight.

1097
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:15,862
We can't count on the 1 million men we captured in Jiangnan

1098
01:28:15,862 --> 01:28:18,863
They can barely hold their rifles

1099
01:28:20,032 --> 01:28:25,822
The Yangtze is lost.

1100
01:28:27,915 --> 01:28:31,961
You intend to evacuate to Taiwan?

1101
01:28:31,961 --> 01:28:33,788
You're coming too.

1102
01:28:40,052 --> 01:28:44,891
You think Li Zongren won't get anywhere

1103
01:28:44,891 --> 01:28:46,883
with the CPC over the peace negotiations?

1104
01:28:46,976 --> 01:28:48,978
If we can't defeat them at war,

1105
01:28:48,978 --> 01:28:52,845
we won't beat them at the conference table

1106
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:54,942
Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi thought

1107
01:28:54,942 --> 01:28:57,896
the CPC will settle for using the Yangtze as a partition

1108
01:28:58,988 --> 01:29:02,033
They don't know Mao Zedong.

1109
01:29:02,033 --> 01:29:04,952
Mao will never agree to

1110
01:29:04,952 --> 01:29:07,038
separate governments on both sides of the Yangtze?

1111
01:29:07,038 --> 01:29:11,866
Would you accept if it were you?

1112
01:29:14,003 --> 01:29:16,874
That'd depend on the US and the USSR...

1113
01:29:16,964 --> 01:29:20,832
Don't make it so complicated. It doesn't matter what anyone thinks

1114
01:29:21,094 --> 01:29:24,055
China was split into north and south in the past

1115
01:29:24,055 --> 01:29:26,974
but not today.

1116
01:29:26,974 --> 01:29:29,102
Who would want to be blamed for it?

1117
01:29:29,102 --> 01:29:32,019
Definitely not me

1118
01:29:34,065 --> 01:29:36,025
Mr. Zhang Lan

1119
01:29:36,025 --> 01:29:37,944
Right now, in your opinion,

1120
01:29:37,944 --> 01:29:40,861
will the CPC accept the Government's plea for peace?

1121
01:29:41,114 --> 01:29:43,023
Impossible.

1122
01:29:43,116 --> 01:29:45,034
Why is that?

1123
01:29:45,034 --> 01:29:47,995
If Chiang never gives up his so-called constitution,

1124
01:29:47,995 --> 01:29:49,914
The CPC will not recognize it

1125
01:29:49,914 --> 01:29:52,037
and neither will the people.

1126
01:29:52,125 --> 01:29:54,995
You know Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai very well.

1127
01:29:55,086 --> 01:29:58,089
Are they local revolutionaries

1128
01:29:58,089 --> 01:30:01,873
or mere agents working for international communist intelligence bureau?

1129
01:30:01,968 --> 01:30:05,096
What kind of question is that?

1130
01:30:05,096 --> 01:30:09,976
I want to know your view.

1131
01:30:09,976 --> 01:30:13,926
My view is that the CPC catered for the people

1132
01:30:14,021 --> 01:30:16,939
which explains their achievements today.

1133
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:19,902
Achievements?

1134
01:30:19,902 --> 01:30:21,942
Yes, achievements.

1135
01:30:24,949 --> 01:30:26,117
Dear Zuoyi

1136
01:30:26,117 --> 01:30:29,034
You and I have come a long way.

1137
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:32,081
Given the circumstances, you took matters into your own hands.

1138
01:30:32,081 --> 01:30:36,043
There's nothing I can do about that, but I have one request.

1139
01:30:36,043 --> 01:30:39,005
I will send planes to Beiping tomorrow

1140
01:30:39,005 --> 01:30:41,840
to airlift officers of the 13th Army ranked Major or above

1141
01:30:41,924 --> 01:30:42,873
and essential weaponry

1142
01:30:43,968 --> 01:30:46,969
On account of our long standing friendship, please help me out.

1143
01:30:47,972 --> 01:30:49,846
Chiang Chung-cheng.

1144
01:31:28,137 --> 01:31:30,098
Beiping fell Fu Zuoyi surrendered.

1145
01:31:30,098 --> 01:31:32,968
The CPC is moving in on the Yangtze and Nanjing.

1146
01:31:33,059 --> 01:31:36,020
With regards to my plea for peace,

1147
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:37,063
the CPC accepted it

1148
01:31:37,063 --> 01:31:41,013
but raised 8 very harsh conditions.

1149
01:31:42,902 --> 01:31:46,948
Madame, if you speak on behalf of the Government,

1150
01:31:46,948 --> 01:31:48,775
Mao and Zhou may trust me.

1151
01:31:54,122 --> 01:31:56,958
As you know, Mr. Acting President,

1152
01:31:56,958 --> 01:32:02,083
I washed my hands in politics since the onset of the civil war.

1153
01:32:03,005 --> 01:32:07,009
There are rumors in the newspapers about me coming out of retirement.

1154
01:32:07,009 --> 01:32:09,053
The Trust had to issue a denial.

1155
01:32:09,053 --> 01:32:10,880
Madame.

1156
01:32:12,974 --> 01:32:16,102
Dr. Sun founded the KMT.

1157
01:32:16,102 --> 01:32:20,940
You can't sit back and

1158
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:22,055
watch it go to ruin.

1159
01:32:42,044 --> 01:32:46,872
Don't forget, you may be the Acting President,

1160
01:32:48,176 --> 01:32:52,008
but Chiang Kai-shek is still the Party Chairman.

1161
01:33:06,986 --> 01:33:12,033
Looks like the Acting President is having a hard time.

1162
01:33:12,033 --> 01:33:16,031
Chiang stepped down in name only

1163
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:19,869
He still has control of everything.

1164
01:33:19,957 --> 01:33:22,080
Li Zongren does not have enough authority.

1165
01:33:22,168 --> 01:33:25,129
He's only a puppet

1166
01:33:25,129 --> 01:33:30,040
Nothing will come out of the negotiation.

1167
01:33:30,134 --> 01:33:33,052
No wonder you turned him down

1168
01:33:35,014 --> 01:33:37,007
I don't want to go to Beiping

1169
01:33:39,977 --> 01:33:46,941
because Dr. Sun died there. Too many memories.

1170
01:33:53,074 --> 01:33:56,160
Master Zhang, you're a veteran of the United League

1171
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:58,121
and Zhu De's mentor

1172
01:33:58,121 --> 01:34:01,165
Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu have great respect for you.

1173
01:34:01,165 --> 01:34:04,000
The Acting President issued a declaration for peace negotiation

1174
01:34:04,168 --> 01:34:08,914
You're the most suitable person to mediate.

1175
01:34:09,966 --> 01:34:12,967
If the CPC brought up 8 conditions,

1176
01:34:13,052 --> 01:34:14,961
go ahead and talk to them.

1177
01:34:18,182 --> 01:34:20,143
If Mao wants to talk,

1178
01:34:20,143 --> 01:34:22,979
he wouldn't raise these harsh conditions.

1179
01:34:22,979 --> 01:34:27,973
There should be room to negotiate in a negotiation.

1180
01:34:28,067 --> 01:34:33,025
That's why the Acting President sent me to haggle with them

1181
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:35,104
To mediate.

1182
01:34:37,952 --> 01:34:41,950
As you know, the Government clamped down on the CDL.

1183
01:34:42,039 --> 01:34:44,116
It is now an illegal organization

1184
01:34:46,002 --> 01:34:49,005
I'm now in the same party as the Communists.

1185
01:34:49,005 --> 01:34:52,133
Please don't be upset, sir.

1186
01:34:52,133 --> 01:34:54,051
Mr Chiang issued that order,

1187
01:34:54,051 --> 01:34:56,095
not the Acting President.

1188
01:34:56,095 --> 01:34:59,140
I side with the revolutionary.

1189
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:01,184
I won't haggle for the enemy

1190
01:35:01,184 --> 01:35:03,019
Sir.

1191
01:35:03,019 --> 01:35:04,133
See them out

1192
01:35:13,112 --> 01:35:18,901
A partitioned rule? China is not Korea.

1193
01:35:18,993 --> 01:35:21,116
The Yangtze is not the 38th Parallel.

1194
01:35:23,998 --> 01:35:25,113
Wire the General Front Committee.

1195
01:35:27,085 --> 01:35:30,171
Their war plan has been approved

1196
01:35:30,171 --> 01:35:34,916
The central government advises to move the plan up to end of April

1197
01:35:37,011 --> 01:35:38,090
Go

1198
01:35:42,016 --> 01:35:44,092
Hurry Are you ok?

1199
01:36:50,209 --> 01:36:53,044
Don't push

1200
01:37:19,197 --> 01:37:22,114
Lin Biao is still so skinny.

1201
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:24,243
Eating 1 million Nationalist soldiers

1202
01:37:24,243 --> 01:37:27,161
didn't even make him fat

1203
01:37:34,212 --> 01:37:36,047
Comrades

1204
01:37:36,047 --> 01:37:40,176
On behalf of the Secretariat of the Central Politburo, I hereby announce

1205
01:37:40,176 --> 01:37:44,008
the commencement of the second meeting

1206
01:37:44,097 --> 01:37:47,051
of the 7th CPC Central Committee.

1207
01:38:11,207 --> 01:38:14,124
What should we do about Zhang Lan?

1208
01:38:15,086 --> 01:38:17,125
He'd rather die than go to Taiwan.

1209
01:38:17,213 --> 01:38:19,122
He's trouble to us if he stays.

1210
01:38:29,183 --> 01:38:31,140
Give him what he wants

1211
01:38:51,164 --> 01:38:52,195
Sir.

1212
01:38:57,170 --> 01:39:00,005
Get rid of Zhang Lan.

1213
01:39:05,261 --> 01:39:10,266
He's a man of influence, sir

1214
01:39:10,266 --> 01:39:13,144
The more reason to get rid of him.

1215
01:39:13,144 --> 01:39:15,146
I see

1216
01:39:15,146 --> 01:39:18,147
Openly or privately?

1217
01:39:18,232 --> 01:39:21,152
How can you do this openly?

1218
01:39:21,152 --> 01:39:24,106
Like I said, don't let me see him alive.

1219
01:39:24,197 --> 01:39:26,199
And no body if he's dead.

1220
01:39:26,199 --> 01:39:28,025
Don't make a mess.

1221
01:39:29,118 --> 01:39:31,027
I understand

1222
01:39:31,120 --> 01:39:32,151
Go on.

1223
01:39:34,082 --> 01:39:35,991
Take care

1224
01:40:42,150 --> 01:40:43,015
Stop

1225
01:40:46,279 --> 01:40:48,022
Get out.

1226
01:40:57,165 --> 01:40:59,038
Are you Zhang Lan?

1227
01:41:00,084 --> 01:41:01,199
Who are you?

1228
01:41:04,255 --> 01:41:06,129
What do you want?

1229
01:41:07,133 --> 01:41:11,131
Deputy Chief Yan Jinwen of the Shanghai Inspectorate

1230
01:41:13,181 --> 01:41:17,048
On behalf of the CPC, I will get you out

1231
01:41:18,144 --> 01:41:22,058
Trust me.

1232
01:42:00,269 --> 01:42:01,183
Brother Yan.

1233
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:03,180
Morning, you're on duty?

1234
01:42:04,148 --> 01:42:06,057
Security has been tightened lately

1235
01:42:07,276 --> 01:42:09,068
Where are you going?

1236
01:42:10,113 --> 01:42:12,115
On Inspectorate business.

1237
01:42:12,115 --> 01:42:15,151
Mixing pleasure with business. My father is in the car.

1238
01:42:19,330 --> 01:42:24,122
Go ahead, do what you have to

1239
01:42:25,253 --> 01:42:27,126
No need, run along

1240
01:42:29,173 --> 01:42:31,047
Bye.

1241
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:34,218
Let them through

1242
01:42:53,114 --> 01:42:55,153
Where are you taking us?

1243
01:42:56,242 --> 01:42:57,238
Up north

1244
01:43:06,210 --> 01:43:08,254
Enlai, where's the Chairman?

1245
01:43:08,254 --> 01:43:10,128
Went to get smokes.

1246
01:43:10,214 --> 01:43:15,261
Not a shop is open in two blocks.

1247
01:43:15,261 --> 01:43:19,098
Chengjun, you're the county committee secretary.

1248
01:43:19,098 --> 01:43:20,094
This can't go on.

1249
01:43:20,308 --> 01:43:23,311
After entering the city, rumor has it

1250
01:43:23,311 --> 01:43:27,231
capitalists and businessmen are exploiters

1251
01:43:27,231 --> 01:43:29,058
and we should punish them.

1252
01:43:29,317 --> 01:43:33,065
They're so scared no one is open for business.

1253
01:43:34,197 --> 01:43:36,324
This is not a small matter.

1254
01:43:36,324 --> 01:43:40,108
Revolution is our forte

1255
01:43:40,203 --> 01:43:44,070
but not economics.

1256
01:43:44,165 --> 01:43:47,126
Can't even get smokes without the merchants,

1257
01:43:47,126 --> 01:43:49,119
let alone market prosperity.

1258
01:43:49,212 --> 01:43:51,172
We need the capitalists back.

1259
01:43:51,172 --> 01:43:54,126
At this stage, we can't eliminate them yet.

1260
01:43:55,134 --> 01:43:57,303
Production must be handled with care.

1261
01:43:57,303 --> 01:44:01,099
If anything goes wrong,

1262
01:44:01,099 --> 01:44:04,053
it'll be worse than losing a battle.

1263
01:44:04,143 --> 01:44:06,145
We must know our limits

1264
01:44:06,145 --> 01:44:09,190
We must learn from scratch.

1265
01:44:09,190 --> 01:44:12,151
The gist of political consultation

1266
01:44:12,151 --> 01:44:15,154
involves capitalists and democracy activists.

1267
01:44:15,154 --> 01:44:17,156
We invite them to help run the country,

1268
01:44:17,156 --> 01:44:19,158
not to eliminate them.

1269
01:44:19,158 --> 01:44:23,238
We must be very clear on this: If we destroy them

1270
01:44:23,329 --> 01:44:25,286
and we can't run production on our own,

1271
01:44:27,208 --> 01:44:30,244
factories will close down and worker will lose their jobs.

1272
01:44:31,337 --> 01:44:34,042
We'll be smashing our own rice bowls.

1273
01:44:35,216 --> 01:44:40,211
We barely got our hands on them, don't smash them.

1274
01:44:57,071 --> 01:45:01,899
Comrades, we ask two things of you.

1275
01:45:01,993 --> 01:45:04,994
Keep your backs straight and your voices up, understand?

1276
01:45:05,079 --> 01:45:07,119
Yes.

1277
01:45:59,217 --> 01:46:02,087
Chairman Mao

1278
01:46:02,178 --> 01:46:05,049
General Fu, you flatter me.

1279
01:46:05,223 --> 01:46:10,098
I promised to hold your horsewhip if I lose.

1280
01:46:11,020 --> 01:46:12,977
Today, I'll hold the door for you.

1281
01:46:13,064 --> 01:46:16,978
You did not lose The loser is in Nanjing.

1282
01:46:19,112 --> 01:46:23,116
Don't hold the door for me

1283
01:46:23,116 --> 01:46:25,986
Help me open the door for a new China.

1284
01:46:37,213 --> 01:46:39,170
Salute

1285
01:46:46,055 --> 01:46:47,218
Sir.

1286
01:46:47,306 --> 01:46:51,090
I'm with the 28th Army

1287
01:46:54,105 --> 01:46:57,191
I'm here with the Tashan troops

1288
01:46:57,191 --> 01:46:59,148
to join the dress parade.

1289
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:04,153
On behalf of

1290
01:47:06,242 --> 01:47:13,123
soldiers of the Red Army, dead or alive,

1291
01:47:15,126 --> 01:47:20,084
I salute you, Chairman Mao.

1292
01:47:32,310 --> 01:47:38,182
Forward...

1293
01:47:40,193 --> 01:47:45,234
Forward...

1294
01:47:46,157 --> 01:47:50,285
Forward...

1295
01:47:55,166 --> 01:48:05,301
Long live Chairman Mao

1296
01:48:05,301 --> 01:48:07,210
Are these the 100,000 used guns

1297
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:12,266
you mentioned in Chongqing three years ago?

1298
01:48:12,266 --> 01:48:16,311
The CPC has come a long way

1299
01:48:17,230 --> 01:48:21,401
Long live Chairman Mao

1300
01:48:21,401 --> 01:48:26,276
Long live Commander Zhu

1301
01:48:31,369 --> 01:48:35,319
Long live Chairman Mao

1302
01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:41,212
Long live Commander Zhu

1303
01:48:41,212 --> 01:48:45,210
Long live Chairman Mao

1304
01:49:57,497 --> 01:50:02,242
Since they're crossing the Yangtze River anyway,

1305
01:50:02,335 --> 01:50:04,244
what the hell is the point of negotiation?

1306
01:50:04,337 --> 01:50:07,423
To surrender before the fight begins? I'm a soldier, I won't do it.

1307
01:50:07,423 --> 01:50:11,469
The CPC knew you're different from Chiang.

1308
01:50:11,469 --> 01:50:13,426
Mao knows you enjoy being in the army.

1309
01:50:14,347 --> 01:50:18,518
He personally told me you might continue to command the troops

1310
01:50:18,518 --> 01:50:20,427
up to as many as 400,000

1311
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:24,434
Nonsense. I'm already the Minister of National Defense.

1312
01:50:27,443 --> 01:50:29,529
Zongren, we don't get along with Chiang.

1313
01:50:29,529 --> 01:50:32,323
That's our internal business.

1314
01:50:32,323 --> 01:50:34,399
It's not up to the Communists to jack us around.

1315
01:50:35,493 --> 01:50:38,410
What's the use of saying that now?

1316
01:50:40,540 --> 01:50:42,413
What are you suggesting then?

1317
01:50:44,419 --> 01:50:46,245
Let's wait for word from Xikou.

1318
01:51:35,553 --> 01:51:37,513
300,000 courageous PLA

1319
01:51:37,513 --> 01:51:41,476
crossed the Yangtze River on the 21 st.

1320
01:51:41,476 --> 01:51:44,430
The campaign started at midnight on the 20th.

1321
01:51:46,439 --> 01:51:49,440
Didn't even hold the defense line for one day.

1322
01:51:52,528 --> 01:51:54,572
He Yingqin is retreating.

1323
01:51:54,572 --> 01:51:56,529
They say to Guangzhou.

1324
01:51:57,492 --> 01:51:58,571
Shall we go with them?

1325
01:51:58,659 --> 01:52:02,443
I have to look after the interests of the United States

1326
01:52:03,456 --> 01:52:05,413
I should stay here in Nanjing.

1327
01:52:08,419 --> 01:52:11,589
I heard the Soviet embassy

1328
01:52:11,589 --> 01:52:14,507
had relocated to Guangzhou with the Government.

1329
01:52:37,615 --> 01:52:40,493
Morning, Madam. Morning

1330
01:52:40,493 --> 01:52:43,663
The sound of gunfire went on all night. It finally stopped.

1331
01:52:43,663 --> 01:52:47,458
Madam, you didn't sleep well.

1332
01:52:47,458 --> 01:52:49,415
I'll go for a walk.

1333
01:55:05,847 --> 01:55:10,674
Have you decided to leave?

1334
01:55:11,686 --> 01:55:12,717
Really?

1335
01:55:24,699 --> 01:55:26,701
Hello, Chairman Mao.

1336
01:55:26,701 --> 01:55:27,732
Hello, Chairman Mao.

1337
01:55:30,747 --> 01:55:32,573
Hello Jishen.

1338
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:37,699
Mr. Zhou. This way, please.

1339
01:55:38,713 --> 01:55:41,583
Chairman, Zhang Lan is here.

1340
01:55:46,804 --> 01:55:49,758
Mr. Mao, you flatter me

1341
01:55:49,849 --> 01:55:52,684
Not at all.

1342
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:55,685
Master Zhang, how are you? Mr Zhou

1343
01:55:55,772 --> 01:55:56,767
Welcome, please come this way.

1344
01:55:56,856 --> 01:55:57,852
Hello, Master Zhang.

1345
01:56:16,751 --> 01:56:20,713
Calling the CPPCC to establish a new people's Government,

1346
01:56:20,713 --> 01:56:24,711
I recommend you both for Vice Presidents.

1347
01:56:24,801 --> 01:56:28,805
I'd like to hear your opinion.

1348
01:56:28,805 --> 01:56:30,762
I'll go along with your arrangement.

1349
01:56:33,768 --> 01:56:34,799
You have something to say?

1350
01:56:40,858 --> 01:56:44,690
Is this your idea?

1351
01:56:45,905 --> 01:56:48,692
The Central Committee's idea

1352
01:56:53,871 --> 01:56:56,706
I killed members of your party.

1353
01:57:09,804 --> 01:57:11,761
That was then, this is now.

1354
01:57:12,849 --> 01:57:14,806
All roads lead to Rome.

1355
01:57:14,892 --> 01:57:19,803
We can't change history.

1356
01:57:19,981 --> 01:57:22,851
Nobody's perfect.

1357
01:57:23,776 --> 01:57:26,777
A personal matter, no matter how important, is a minor issue.

1358
01:57:26,863 --> 01:57:31,993
A state matter, no matter how trivial, is a major issue, For the new state,

1359
01:57:31,993 --> 01:57:35,825
be our Vice President on behalf of the Revolutionary Committee.

1360
01:57:36,789 --> 01:57:39,790
This is a state matter

1361
01:57:39,876 --> 01:57:43,004
Forget the past.

1362
01:57:43,004 --> 01:57:46,883
The CPC is willing to work with you to lead this country.

1363
01:57:46,883 --> 01:57:49,969
Let's help each other, as we're in the same boat now

1364
01:57:49,969 --> 01:57:52,840
Together, we'll make history.

1365
01:57:56,893 --> 01:58:00,021
As you wish.

1366
01:58:00,021 --> 01:58:04,849
I'll do my best for China.

1367
01:58:16,996 --> 01:58:19,914
We strongly urge our comrades in China

1368
01:58:19,999 --> 01:58:22,953
to set up their own government soon

1369
01:58:24,003 --> 01:58:27,048
The USSR will, at the earliest time possible,

1370
01:58:27,048 --> 01:58:29,918
set up diplomatic relations with the new regime.

1371
01:58:36,099 --> 01:58:38,008
That's wonderful.

1372
01:58:40,895 --> 01:58:46,901
The frantic bombing of Shanghai by the KMT is causing chaos.

1373
01:58:46,901 --> 01:58:49,985
I'm worried about Madam Sun's safety.

1374
01:58:50,947 --> 01:58:53,983
She's our most faithful friend when we were in dire straits

1375
01:58:54,951 --> 01:58:57,870
The new CPPCC is about to commence.

1376
01:58:57,870 --> 01:59:02,041
It won't be complete without her.

1377
01:59:02,041 --> 01:59:04,001
Men like us

1378
01:59:04,001 --> 01:59:05,959
won't know how to talk to her.

1379
01:59:06,045 --> 01:59:09,913
Send a female comrade to escort her here.

1380
01:59:10,967 --> 01:59:15,096
Enlai, we'II burden Yingchao with the task

1381
01:59:15,096 --> 01:59:17,932
Good idea.

1382
01:59:17,932 --> 01:59:20,933
Madam Zhou to escort Madam Sun.

1383
01:59:21,978 --> 01:59:26,022
I'll tell her right away.

1384
01:59:32,071 --> 01:59:34,115
To form a coalition government without you

1385
01:59:34,115 --> 01:59:35,989
is something the Party will never agree to.

1386
01:59:36,075 --> 01:59:40,997
Neither would the rest of the country

1387
01:59:40,997 --> 01:59:43,073
I'm only the vanguard

1388
01:59:43,166 --> 01:59:46,127
If I failed to convince you, Enlai would be next

1389
01:59:46,127 --> 01:59:51,007
and then Chairman Mao himself.

1390
01:59:51,007 --> 01:59:54,177
If we all failed to convince you,

1391
01:59:54,177 --> 01:59:56,881
we'd put this on the agenda of the CPPCC,

1392
01:59:56,971 --> 02:00:00,007
vote on it and send a delegation.

1393
02:00:03,102 --> 02:00:04,929
You Communists

1394
02:00:05,021 --> 02:00:08,057
won't stop until you get what you want.

1395
02:00:08,149 --> 02:00:12,016
What do you think of this house?

1396
02:00:12,111 --> 02:00:16,026
Not bad, spacious and bright.

1397
02:00:16,115 --> 02:00:20,119
Mayor Chen Yi said he'd giving it to you

1398
02:00:20,119 --> 02:00:22,997
as a permanent site for the youth center

1399
02:00:22,997 --> 02:00:24,165
of your China Welfare Fund.

1400
02:00:24,165 --> 02:00:26,167
The children can play in here every day.

1401
02:00:26,167 --> 02:00:28,041
That's wonderful.

1402
02:01:04,122 --> 02:01:05,117
Madam Sun

1403
02:01:05,206 --> 02:01:09,156
Times have changed, Zedong. You mustn't do that.

1404
02:01:09,252 --> 02:01:12,169
Only for Madam Sun.

1405
02:01:13,131 --> 02:01:16,131
Thanks for the invitation and Yingchao's company.

1406
02:01:18,094 --> 02:01:20,170
Now the Party can work with all delegates

1407
02:01:20,263 --> 02:01:23,057
to build a new state,

1408
02:01:23,057 --> 02:01:25,975
I must thank your help and support.

1409
02:01:26,060 --> 02:01:28,146
You have been a great help to the country and its people

1410
02:01:28,146 --> 02:01:30,138
and a benefactor of our Party.

1411
02:01:34,277 --> 02:01:36,020
Fellow delegates,

1412
02:01:36,279 --> 02:01:40,199
the yellow flag pole in the center of figure No 1 represents the Yellow River.

1413
02:01:40,199 --> 02:01:44,114
It stands out. Those in favor, please raise your hands.

1414
02:01:48,124 --> 02:01:51,252
Good. It's unilateral.

1415
02:01:51,252 --> 02:01:52,248
I object.

1416
02:01:53,254 --> 02:01:54,255
From an artistic perspective,

1417
02:01:54,255 --> 02:01:57,173
No. 32 is much better.

1418
02:01:57,258 --> 02:01:59,260
Mr. Tian is an artist

1419
02:01:59,260 --> 02:02:02,012
who's partial to the 5 stars.

1420
02:02:04,223 --> 02:02:06,184
The person who submitted this design

1421
02:02:06,184 --> 02:02:08,093
is an ordinary clerk from Shanghai

1422
02:02:08,269 --> 02:02:12,183
It was disqualified in the first round, but I want to bring it up again.

1423
02:02:13,274 --> 02:02:15,183
Because this design

1424
02:02:16,194 --> 02:02:17,273
is full of emotions.

1425
02:02:20,114 --> 02:02:23,199
I object to the version of the 4 stars representing the 4 classes.

1426
02:02:23,284 --> 02:02:28,164
I prefer the Yellow River pattern.

1427
02:02:28,164 --> 02:02:30,166
Simple and sharp.

1428
02:02:30,166 --> 02:02:32,159
How many in favor of the 5-star flag?

1429
02:02:40,259 --> 02:02:43,346
Delegate Xu Beihong suggests

1430
02:02:43,346 --> 02:02:46,263
we use "March of the Volunteers" as the national anthem

1431
02:02:46,349 --> 02:02:48,223
Let's hear your comments

1432
02:02:50,269 --> 02:02:55,191
The melody is good, but we need to change the lyrics.

1433
02:02:55,191 --> 02:02:58,236
This is a new China.

1434
02:02:58,236 --> 02:03:02,240
The original lyrics are outdated.

1435
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:05,243
Mr. Tian Han, you're the lyricist.

1436
02:03:05,243 --> 02:03:07,286
What's your opinion?

1437
02:03:07,286 --> 02:03:10,122
I should refrain from commenting. I'll listen to the others.

1438
02:03:10,206 --> 02:03:14,168
I agree we should change the lyrics

1439
02:03:14,168 --> 02:03:15,283
We can't sing it every day,

1440
02:03:15,378 --> 02:03:17,255
especially this line:

1441
02:03:17,255 --> 02:03:19,382
its greatest peril."

1442
02:03:19,382 --> 02:03:21,217
It won't work

1443
02:03:21,217 --> 02:03:24,178
I disagree, "La Marseillaise" of France

1444
02:03:24,178 --> 02:03:28,307
is tragic but has been handed down till now

1445
02:03:28,307 --> 02:03:30,309
That's France, not China

1446
02:03:30,309 --> 02:03:34,224
The lyrics of the song remind us

1447
02:03:35,314 --> 02:03:39,358
not to forget the past. I agree

1448
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:43,228
New China needs a new song for its new outlook.

1449
02:03:43,322 --> 02:03:46,276
Why use a song from an old movie?

1450
02:03:48,286 --> 02:03:49,365
What about you, Mr. Li?

1451
02:03:56,294 --> 02:04:00,208
was written for the war

1452
02:04:00,465 --> 02:04:05,292
I sang it before. It's inspirational and gets my blood boiling.

1453
02:04:06,345 --> 02:04:09,299
become our new Great Wall".

1454
02:04:10,433 --> 02:04:13,268
We must remember history.

1455
02:04:13,352 --> 02:04:16,188
No need to change the lyrics.

1456
02:04:16,272 --> 02:04:17,351
Well said.

1457
02:04:18,399 --> 02:04:23,404
Agree. I have a good sense for danger too

1458
02:04:23,404 --> 02:04:26,405
The Chairman wishes to keep the original lyrics.

1459
02:04:29,494 --> 02:04:33,242
What about you? You kept raising your hand.

1460
02:04:34,290 --> 02:04:36,413
They took the words out of my mouth I have no comment.

1461
02:04:39,420 --> 02:04:41,247
Let me say just one thing.

1462
02:04:44,300 --> 02:04:50,389
To be vigilant in peace time is what a mature nation should do

1463
02:04:50,389 --> 02:04:54,304
We'll let Mr. Tian Han decide

1464
02:04:56,395 --> 02:04:58,353
Then let's keep the lyrics.

1465
02:05:25,216 --> 02:05:27,090
Chairman Mao, fellow delegates.

1466
02:05:27,218 --> 02:05:29,009
Are you ready?

1467
02:05:32,098 --> 02:05:34,090
Look over here, ready.

1468
02:05:38,271 --> 02:05:41,141
This is a women's delegation.

1469
02:05:43,276 --> 02:05:48,114
Chairman, everyone is talking about the pattern on the national flag.

1470
02:05:48,114 --> 02:05:50,199
What do you think?

1471
02:05:50,199 --> 02:05:53,202
I like the Yellow River.

1472
02:05:53,202 --> 02:05:54,198
I disagree.

1473
02:05:59,333 --> 02:06:02,295
Can you fix the negative? Yes.

1474
02:06:02,295 --> 02:06:03,291
Take out the person next to me.

1475
02:06:04,297 --> 02:06:06,215
There are over 10 people next to you.

1476
02:06:06,215 --> 02:06:08,172
I mean the man who jammed in

1477
02:06:10,261 --> 02:06:13,222
Alright. Thank you

1478
02:06:13,222 --> 02:06:16,307
What's your reason?

1479
02:06:16,392 --> 02:06:21,147
Chairman, adding a pole to the middle

1480
02:06:21,147 --> 02:06:23,191
gives the impression of splitting up the country.

1481
02:06:23,191 --> 02:06:25,276
Is that the right interpretation?

1482
02:06:25,276 --> 02:06:29,190
Can't be that serious. Most people prefer this one

1483
02:06:30,156 --> 02:06:33,240
Gong Peng, what do you think?

1484
02:06:35,203 --> 02:06:38,206
We like No 32

1485
02:06:38,206 --> 02:06:40,374
Placing five stars in the left corner

1486
02:06:40,374 --> 02:06:42,166
with four small stars surrounding

1487
02:06:42,251 --> 02:06:45,371
and their tips pointing at the big star It looks pretty.

1488
02:06:46,380 --> 02:06:50,384
Chairman, the big star in the middle represents the Party

1489
02:06:50,384 --> 02:06:53,172
while the small ones represent the 4 classes

1490
02:06:53,262 --> 02:06:54,263
The symbolism is correct.

1491
02:06:54,263 --> 02:06:59,310
Looking at this flag makes one feel enthusiastic.

1492
02:06:59,310 --> 02:07:00,394
Enthusiastic?

1493
02:07:00,394 --> 02:07:03,265
I feel excited when I look at the flag.

1494
02:07:04,315 --> 02:07:07,316
Madam Sun likes this design too.

1495
02:07:07,402 --> 02:07:10,405
You have been abroad, your opinion should count

1496
02:07:10,405 --> 02:07:12,231
Please tell us what you think.

1497
02:07:13,408 --> 02:07:17,328
The five stars design is a good representation of China's situation.

1498
02:07:17,328 --> 02:07:19,414
Under the leadership of the CPC,

1499
02:07:19,414 --> 02:07:23,292
all the classes are united to build a new China

1500
02:07:23,292 --> 02:07:26,504
The color is sharp, solemn and grand.

1501
02:07:26,504 --> 02:07:31,380
The truth is, China is united. Well said.

1502
02:07:32,385 --> 02:07:37,343
We're united now and we'll always be in the future.

1503
02:07:38,349 --> 02:07:40,425
Is the air raid on Beiping feasible?

1504
02:07:41,436 --> 02:07:44,390
The Chairman wants feedback from the Air Force.

1505
02:07:51,404 --> 02:07:53,278
The flying radius is too big.

1506
02:07:55,491 --> 02:07:58,409
The planes must re-tank somewhere

1507
02:08:00,496 --> 02:08:03,374
or they won't make it back.

1508
02:08:03,374 --> 02:08:05,460
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has liaised with the Americans in Korea

1509
02:08:05,460 --> 02:08:07,369
You can rest assured.

1510
02:08:13,468 --> 02:08:16,512
But the CPC has its air force now.

1511
02:08:16,512 --> 02:08:19,390
The Chairman only wants to know

1512
02:08:19,390 --> 02:08:23,340
if the air raid is feasible. That's all.

1513
02:08:30,610 --> 02:08:37,450
Despite the difficulties, as long as he issues the order,

1514
02:08:37,450 --> 02:08:39,407
we'll get it done.

1515
02:08:53,633 --> 02:08:56,503
Fellow delegates,

1516
02:08:56,594 --> 02:09:00,681
the CPPCC that the whole country is looking forward to

1517
02:09:00,681 --> 02:09:02,473
will now commence.

1518
02:09:07,480 --> 02:09:10,608
The new CPPCC

1519
02:09:10,608 --> 02:09:13,694
will commence on a brand new foundation

1520
02:09:13,694 --> 02:09:16,648
It represents the Chinese people

1521
02:09:17,698 --> 02:09:23,538
and has the people's faith and support

1522
02:09:23,538 --> 02:09:27,582
Therefore, the CPPCC hereby announces

1523
02:09:27,667 --> 02:09:31,665
its right to call this meeting

1524
02:09:37,593 --> 02:09:40,464
Fellow delegates,

1525
02:09:40,555 --> 02:09:44,600
we have a consensus

1526
02:09:44,600 --> 02:09:46,602
that our work here

1527
02:09:46,602 --> 02:09:49,689
will go down in history.

1528
02:09:49,689 --> 02:09:53,603
It proves that China, which accounts for 1/4 of the world's population,

1529
02:09:53,693 --> 02:09:56,647
is finally on her feet

1530
02:10:06,748 --> 02:10:12,670
The destiny of China is in the hands of her people

1531
02:10:12,670 --> 02:10:16,632
China will rise like the sun in the east.

1532
02:10:16,632 --> 02:10:20,713
Its radiance will illuminate the land

1533
02:10:20,803 --> 02:10:25,808
and cleanse the filth and mire left behind by the reactionary government.

1534
02:10:25,808 --> 02:10:30,772
Heal the wounds of war and build a brand new

1535
02:10:30,772 --> 02:10:36,652
and powerful People's Republic of China.

1536
02:10:36,652 --> 02:10:38,738
Long live the People's Republic of China.

1537
02:10:38,738 --> 02:10:40,740
Long live the Coalition Government.

1538
02:10:40,740 --> 02:10:42,816
Long live the unity of the people

1539
02:12:40,026 --> 02:12:42,111
According to Commander Zhou,

1540
02:12:42,111 --> 02:12:44,030
the planes are in Class A status.

1541
02:12:44,030 --> 02:12:46,900
They're ready to bombard Beiping any time.

1542
02:12:48,993 --> 02:12:53,988
But the US has turned down our request to refuel in Pusan.

1543
02:12:58,086 --> 02:13:00,004
What does that mean?

1544
02:13:00,004 --> 02:13:04,999
They can't come back after takeoff.

1545
02:13:16,187 --> 02:13:21,015
What time is Mao's founding ceremony?

1546
02:13:22,026 --> 02:13:24,944
3pm at Tiananmen Square.

1547
02:13:51,222 --> 02:14:06,193
It's fate. The KMT is ruined with our own hands

1548
02:14:10,241 --> 02:14:12,198
Cancel the mission

1549
02:14:15,079 --> 02:14:16,194
Yes, sir

1550
02:15:07,340 --> 02:15:13,212
The People's Republic of China and

1551
02:15:14,347 --> 02:15:18,214
the Central People's Government

1552
02:15:18,434 --> 02:15:22,349
have been established today
