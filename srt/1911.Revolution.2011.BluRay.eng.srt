1
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:48,950
I die

2
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,540
for the Revolution.

3
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,830
No Chinese Woman has yet shed blood for the Revolution.

4
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,000
I shall be the first,

5
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,330
although the world doesn't know much about the Revolution.

6
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,200
I leave behind my husband and children.

7
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,290
My death

8
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,500
is my contribution to the Revolution.

9
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,500
It will build an indestructible home for all people,

10
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,700
a peaceful and calm world for all children.

11
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,700
The long-enslaved masses are numb,

12
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,580
they know not peace, nor calm.

13
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,120
These two children

14
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,410
will soon lose their mother.

15
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,700
I die for all children.

16
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,500
I die for the Revolution.

17
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,120
I'm not afraid, nor do I care about death.

18
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,910
I rejoice at my martyrdom:

19
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,580
At this moment

20
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,910
I cry with blissful tears.

21
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,450
Put the donation boxes in prominent spots.

22
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,660
Go over to the door.

23
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,830
Be vigilant.

24
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,790
Yes.

25
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,620
Let Mr. Sun rest.

26
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,370
Don't disturb him.

27
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,290
Yes.

28
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,370
Juemin.

29
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,370
Who's that?

30
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,250
Who?

31
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,200
Look.

32
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,540
What?

33
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,120
Go, quick.

34
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,080
Get up, there's a woman here.

35
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,250
Don't bother, just go.

36
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,290
Keqiang.

37
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,330
Time to get up.

38
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,080
Get up.

39
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,000
Let me sleep three more minutes.

40
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,120
Alright.

41
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,330
Get up.

42
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,040
Two minutes.

43
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,080
Fine.

44
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,160
Two minutes.

45
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,410
One minutes.

46
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,000
I'll get up.

47
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,580
I should go to Guangzhou for the uprising.

48
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,700
What?

49
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,950
You forgot the committee's decision last night?

50
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,580
Keqiang, listen.

51
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,450
I won't.

52
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,750
I must throw myself into battle.

53
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,540
Then last night's meeting was a waste.

54
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,250
Why can't we talk it through again?

55
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,660
There's nothing to discuss.

56
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,660
Huang Xing leads the Guangzhou uprising.

57
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,750
Sun Wen handles fundraising overseas.

58
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,370
We voted.

59
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,620
Promise.

60
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,120
Promise.

61
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,620
These are donations from abroad.

62
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,580
Overseas Chinese helped us.

63
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,830
I promised them.

64
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,040
I cannot fail them,

65
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,080
I must carry out my pledge.

66
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,040
It's not a personal promise

67
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,950
but Tongmenghui's promise.

68
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,660
They wrote these letters.

69
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,330
Who's this Woman?

70
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,330
Zonghan.

71
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,000
Xu Zonghan.

72
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,120
Tongmenghui member from my village.

73
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,870
I'm Huang Xing.

74
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,540
Zonghan coordinates underground organizations in Guangzhou.

75
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,620
You two pretend to be husband and wife.

76
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,160
It's a good cover.

77
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,450
No, it's not appropriate.

78
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,910
Why not?

79
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,660
I'm a woman and I don't care.

80
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,870
What are you afraid of?

81
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,120
It's easy to die in battle,

82
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,580
but hard to motivate the living.

83
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,250
You have the difficult task.

84
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:37,080
The Guangzhou uprising will finish off the Qing Dynasty.

85
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,370
Take this pocket watch.

86
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,080
On the day of the uprising,

87
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,160
we'll monitor time together.

88
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:05,910
Go,

89
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,750
Charge.

90
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,620
Quick.

91
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,160
Quick.

92
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,950
Destroy this wall.

93
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,040
Yes.

94
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,830
You rebel.

95
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,290
You dare revolt.

96
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,580
You revolutionary.

97
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,450
You dare revolt.

98
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,910
You...

99
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,250
You...

100
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,660
Where's Zhang Mingqi?

101
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:45,540
I don't know.

102
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,200
Quick.

103
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,700
And my Wife.

104
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,370
Quick.

105
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,910
Comrades taking part in the uprising

106
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,330
know me better.

107
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,290
It's easier for me to coordinate...

108
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,620
Nonsense.

109
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,540
I can wield my pen

110
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,500
and scalpel,

111
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,910
why not a gun?

112
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,370
Remember: You're still a wanted man by the Qing court,

113
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,790
you can't risk it.

114
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,750
If you return to China to lead the uprising,

115
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,750
you're being irresponsible.

116
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,910
Yu Peilun.

117
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,290
Yu Peilun.

118
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,000
Yu Peilun.

119
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,120
Here.

120
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,500
We couldn't Contact the other groups.

121
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,040
Zhang Mingqi ran away.

122
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,410
Keqiang said,

123
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,910
if the uprising fails,

124
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,540
you must inform Sun Wen immediately.

125
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,410
What else did he say?

126
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,660
He said,

127
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,450
if he's not back by dusk,

128
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,330
you must leave Guangzhou at once.

129
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,540
Quick.

130
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,120
Back off. All of you.

131
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,120
Listen to my command.

132
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,290
Attack from the sides.

133
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,370
- Yes. - Hand grenades.

134
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:19,910
- Yes. - Follow me.

135
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,580
Charge.

136
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,620
Charge.

137
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,200
Keqiang.

138
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,500
Your hand.

139
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,120
Keqiang.

140
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,830
Don't mind me, charge.

141
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,660
Yes.

142
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:40,660
Charge.

143
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,040
Get away.

144
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,540
Run.

145
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,700
- What are you doing? - Run.

146
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,700
Let me go.

147
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,160
Let me go.

148
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,750
Yu Peilun.

149
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:45,910
Gentlemen,

150
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,830
our fundraiser today

151
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,620
was originally organized for the Guangzhou uprising.

152
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,700
But just now,

153
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,790
I received news.

154
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,080
Fighting in Guangzhou has ceased.

155
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,950
The uprising has failed.

156
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,580
The telegram states,

157
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,500
the uprising failed,

158
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,160
many of our core members are dead.

159
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,250
You've never met them.

160
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:24,120
These young people who died were talented,

161
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,330
some came from rich families,

162
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,910
some have just gotten married.

163
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:31,700
They were willing to sacrifice themselves,

164
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,620
whatever the cost.

165
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,290
They sacrificed their lives for the cause

166
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,040
because they have faith.

167
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,080
What do your lies

168
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,540
have to do with us?

169
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,870
Good question.

170
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,660
Most of you gathered here

171
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,790
are overseas Chinese.

172
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,500
You know Well

173
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,410
our faces mark us as Chinese,

174
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,160
and we've suffered discrimination

175
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,290
and bullying.

176
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,160
We've endured unfair treatment.

177
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,160
All because the country of our people

178
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,080
has long been corrupt

179
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,450
and weak,

180
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,250
writhing in pain.

181
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,830
Our Chinese compatriots

182
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
face adversity,

183
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,620
our land taken by others.

184
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,160
Our Revolution

185
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,830
ensures people can pursue happiness,

186
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,040
that our race will regain dignity.

187
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,250
The Chinese revolutionary movement is blessed by support from overseas Chinese.

188
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,790
For many years,

189
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,700
I strongly believe this.

190
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,040
Overseas Chinese are the mother of the Revolution.

191
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,660
Gentlemen,

192
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,450
your children

193
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,410
have died for you.

194
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,200
Fang Shengdong.

195
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,450
Lin Shishuang.

196
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,450
Yu Peilun.

197
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,450
Chen Gengxin.

198
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:04,330
Lin Juemin.

199
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:09,000
This young man will soon be a father.

200
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:33,950
What's this?

201
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,500
US$300,000.00

202
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,450
Donation from Zhigongtang

203
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,660
I won't hide this from you.

204
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,790
We sold our ancestral house.

205
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:49,870
Yat-sen,

206
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,200
we're overseas Chinese,

207
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,950
our roots are in China.

208
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,160
The Qing Dynasty is no longer our home.

209
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,160
Without a place called home,

210
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,200
why Keep an ancestral house?

211
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,410
Take it.

212
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,330
If the Revolution fails,

213
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,700
you'll owe us for generations.

214
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,330
Another one.

215
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,790
Yat-sen,

216
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,080
your pocket Watch

217
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,620
can block bullets,

218
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,040
but not cannon shells.

219
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,750
Fire.

220
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,080
Empress Dowager,

221
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,080
I hear.

222
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,790
Sun Wen has long escaped abroad,

223
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,540
he hasn't returned for more than a decade.

224
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,830
We might want to arrest him,

225
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,830
but it's going to be hard.

226
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,910
Didn't we alert our envoys

227
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,660
and foreign governments

228
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,790
about Sun, telling them

229
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,700
they should monitor his movements?

230
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,500
But Sun gives public lectures everywhere,

231
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,000
raising funds, organizing rebels,

232
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,790
trafficking arms, plotting uprisings.

233
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,660
Minister Xu, perhaps you overstate.

234
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,580
He hasn't appeared before our eyes.

235
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,370
He's only mortal,

236
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,870
not the Monkey King.

237
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,950
What power can he wield?

238
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,870
Sun's done enough to rock the boat.

239
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,790
These years, unrest seethes everywhere,

240
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,830
rebellions follow one after another.

241
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,500
Sun's been misleading others with his lies,

242
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,160
so many follow his path.

243
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,950
What a troublemaker.

244
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,660
As if he doesn't make enough trouble.

245
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,080
The Qing Dynasty will not fall because of him.

246
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,870
If he dares enter the Forbidden City,

247
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,580
our Manchurian imperial army will kill him.

248
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:56,450
Yes,

249
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,620
let's just eradicate.

250
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,500
Sun Wen and his cohorts.

251
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,660
We'll destroy them once and for all.

252
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,250
Stop carrying on like this.

253
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,450
No matter whether to kill them,

254
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,830
or praise or punish them,

255
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,870
or whatever other solution,

256
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,080
I only have this to say:

257
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,200
Please, all of you,

258
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,580
let Us have some peace.

259
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,290
Recently,

260
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,500
the mortgage of our railways

261
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,000
against the Four Nations Bank loan

262
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,660
has led to riots.

263
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,500
What's the use of your rifles?

264
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,290
Tell them:

265
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,950
If they revolt,

266
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,370
they'll all die in vain.

267
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,660
Lin Juemin.

268
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,500
You're educated,

269
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,450
you come from a good family.

270
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:05,330
Why did you join the rebels?

271
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,790
Zhang Mingqi,

272
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,450
why do you hide in darkness?

273
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,540
What are you afraid of?

274
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,410
What am I afraid of?

275
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,790
You're afraid of my youth.

276
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,450
I have chosen death,

277
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,290
but I'm still young.

278
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,120
You might live,

279
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,500
but you are old and worthless.

280
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,080
Have you read the study of evolution?

281
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,080
Survival of the fittest.

282
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,540
Have you considered

283
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,410
the leading nations in the world

284
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,410
were all borne of revolution?

285
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,910
China must also have a revolution.

286
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,040
Affairs of the nation

287
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,620
are not your concern.

288
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,040
Sun Wen said,

289
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,410
China is Weak.

290
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,200
There's no way out.

291
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,660
The royal family, aristocrats and officials

292
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,330
all follow their old ways,

293
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
but what of the people?

294
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,370
They barely survive, ignorant of the world.

295
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,620
China is no match for other countries,

296
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,950
it's a dire situation.

297
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,250
Young man,

298
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,540
the Qing court has a hard time too.

299
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,080
The court?

300
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,870
The court gave Hong Kong to England

301
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,700
and Taiwan to Japan.

302
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:19,080
That's the good Work of the Qing court.

303
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,790
What's the use of keeping it?

304
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,580
I'm interrogating you,

305
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,290
yet you turn around to question me?

306
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,250
You have no grounds to sentence me.

307
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,290
Lin Juemin,

308
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,290
I had wanted to exercise clemency.

309
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,120
There's no need.

310
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,750
My comrades and I fought together,

311
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,040
we'll die together.

312
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,250
I can't be an exception.

313
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,660
When you die,

314
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,450
you'll be left with nothing.

315
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,290
The Qing court wants my life;

316
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,500
I'll destroy the dynasty at its heart.

317
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:29,870
Hello, Your Royal Highness,

318
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,620
this is a car used by British royalty.

319
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,250
As a member of Chinese royalty, let me try.

320
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,290
Please.

321
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,580
You've come because of the Sichuan railways?

322
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:45,750
The loan agreements between our countries

323
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,250
and the mortgage of your railways cannot be written off.

324
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,830
That's the trouble.

325
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,450
I knew it.

326
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,250
The mortgage of the Sichuan and Guangdong railways

327
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:56,620
against your loan

328
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,330
will lead to trouble down the road.

329
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,080
If you forcibly take the railways,

330
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,790
it'll be a catastrophe.

331
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:06,160
Can't we find a solution, my dear lord?

332
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,080
Look at this invention.

333
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,910
It's an iron machine.

334
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,620
It can move forward and backward,

335
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,950
left and right,

336
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,500
whatever you wish.

337
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,290
My lord,

338
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,700
please enjoy this humble gift

339
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,450
and steer it in the right direction.

340
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:23,870
Mr. Ambassador,

341
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,000
we've already sent troops from Wuchang

342
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,120
to suppress the Sichuan riots.

343
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,000
Don't you worry.

344
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,080
Your Royal Highness, you're a great strategist.

345
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,620
You're the one holding the steering wheel.

346
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,830
You have money,

347
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,660
you have navel fleets,

348
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,290
you've always been better businessmen than us.

349
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,500
In 50 years,

350
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,870
the car you gave me

351
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,950
will be scrap metal,

352
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,500
but my little gift to you

353
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,620
will be priceless.

354
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,200
Thank you.

355
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,120
Open the door. Huang Keqiang.

356
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,750
Quick, open the door. Huang Keqiang

357
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,120
I Know you're inside..

358
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,910
Open,

359
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,000
Huang Keqiang.

360
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,750
Huang Keqiang,

361
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,000
open the door.

362
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,410
Open the door for me.

363
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,250
What are you doing?

364
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,700
Put it down.

365
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,830
Give me the blade.

366
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,540
Let me go.

367
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,250
What are you doing?

368
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,290
What?

369
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,660
You can't die.

370
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,200
I know you saw

371
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:59,160
all of them being killed.

372
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,000
I know

373
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,290
we failed.

374
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,080
I didn't want to die, Zonghan

375
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,410
I want to keep this hand

376
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:10,750
to wield the gun.

377
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,580
Help me,

378
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,580
chop it off.

379
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,160
No.

380
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,580
- No. - So we failed,

381
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,870
we've failed before.

382
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,580
No.

383
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,540
Children,

384
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,620
do you know what the telegram says?

385
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,950
No.

386
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,370
Huang Keqiang is alive.

387
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,000
Fate has been kind.

388
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,580
Who's he?

389
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:52,790
Huang Keqiang

390
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,040
is a strong and determined man,

391
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,830
a man who won't die.

392
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,910
We don't know him.

393
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,040
But do you know Homer Lea?

394
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:02,330
Yes.

395
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,450
Take me to him, please.

396
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,620
Yes.

397
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,910
Where's Homer Lea?

398
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,290
There.

399
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,410
Homer Lea.

400
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,830
Homer.

401
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,750
Homer.

402
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,660
- Homer. - Hey, I'm here.

403
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,330
Mr. Lea,

404
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,160
tell me.

405
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,870
Why are you so interested in Chinese revolution?

406
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,370
Nowadays,

407
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,660
a Chinese revolution

408
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:38,040
is the only thing that can make exciting history.

409
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,370
Exciting?

410
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,540
That's not what our revolution is about.

411
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,660
Why revolution?

412
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,450
I was once a doctor.

413
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,000
I used to save a lot of lives

414
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,580
with my scalpel.

415
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,080
But sadly,

416
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,410
in my country,

417
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,870
life is so miserable

418
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,950
it might be Worse than death.

419
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,620
I always wonder

420
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:09,950
why my compatriots

421
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,700
have to endure their lives with no dignity.

422
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,870
They survive like animals

423
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,330
with very basic needs,

424
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,950
suffering the oppression from the ruling class

425
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,830
and foreign powers.

426
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,700
Now,

427
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,700
I cannot accept it,

428
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,450
I will not accept it.

429
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,200
I want to change.

430
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,000
I want a revolution.

431
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,330
Come,

432
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,080
I'll show you.

433
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,000
Recently, in Sichuan,

434
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:47,080
the central part of China, people have launched a movement

435
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:51,910
of protecting railway projects against the hopelessly corrupt Qing government.

436
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:59,000
It is said that the Qing government has to mobilize the army from Hubei province o Sichuan.

437
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:05,120
What they don't know is many officers who stayed behind in the army of.

438
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:08,700
Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangsu,

439
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:13,120
are active members of Tongmenghui, the Restoration League,

440
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,750
I have a feeling

441
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,160
that in the south of Yangtze River,

442
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,750
an even bigger movement

443
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,200
will take hold.

444
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,040
I want to join your revolution.

445
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,000
That's fine.

446
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,830
I would like to invite you

447
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,500
to join the Chinese Revolution as a military advisor,

448
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:34,790
but I'm afraid I cannot afford you and pay the attention that you deserve.

449
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:35,620
This,

450
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,410
this is not about money.

451
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,870
It's about you, Sun.

452
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,250
You must be China's revolutionary leader.

453
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,750
I promise you.

454
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:03,910
Peng Chufan.

455
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,790
Liu Fuji. Yang Hongsheng.

456
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,120
The three of them plotted mutiny.

457
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,290
Now punishment is upon them.

458
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,120
We execute them today

459
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,870
as a Warning to all.

460
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,830
Among you...

461
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,580
Governor,

462
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,660
we found the list. What should we do?

463
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,830
What else can we do with

464
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,620
those rebels from the Gongjinhui?

465
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:26,450
Starting tonight,

466
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,120
kill everyone on the list.

467
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,620
No one will be spared.

468
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,700
All of you,

469
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,370
ask your own conscience.

470
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,000
The Qing court supports

471
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,330
and protects you,

472
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,620
yet you plot to rebel,

473
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,700
following such thugs as Sun Wen.

474
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,160
Isn't that the behavior of unfilial sons,

475
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,660
killing their parents?

476
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,290
Stop, you two.

477
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,660
What are your names?

478
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,120
Xiong Bingkun of the 8th regiment, 8th engineering battalion.

479
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,700
Jin Zheolong of the 8th regiment, 8th engineering battalion.

480
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:13,580
Lie low.

481
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,660
This is a crisis.

482
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:15,580
Don't be hot-tempered.

483
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,500
Yes.

484
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:20,700
What is this?

485
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:22,870
A mutiny?

486
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,080
Not sleeping?

487
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,200
What do you want?

488
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,290
What?

489
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,200
This is a mutiny.

490
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:30,200
Tao Qisheng.

491
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:37,580
Brother,

492
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,910
put down your rifle.

493
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,410
I'm leading a mutiny.

494
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,660
How many more will you kill?

495
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,580
You're lucky that

496
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,370
I'm aiming at you.

497
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,080
Brother,

498
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,870
this is not a joke.

499
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:52,870
If we don't do it now, then when?

500
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:53,950
Help.

501
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,160
Tell Zhang Zhenwu to bring two of his battalions.

502
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,910
Aim all artillery at the Governor's mansion.

503
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,000
When Xiong Bingkun lights the torch,

504
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,910
fire at the mansion.

505
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,750
Yes.

506
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,660
Charge.

507
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:35,830
Hand grenades.

508
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,160
Go.

509
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,370
Jin Zhaolong

510
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:58,450
Jin Zhaolong, Xiong Bingkun.

511
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,160
Lead two platoons.

512
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,620
Order everyone to bring gas canisters.

513
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,830
Rush in to fuel the fire.

514
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,040
Light the target.

515
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:04,790
Yes.

516
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,500
- Quick. - Quick.

517
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,910
Quick.

518
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,330
Quick.

519
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,160
Ready,

520
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,000
aiming at the Governor's mansion.

521
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,080
Load.

522
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,000
Done.

523
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,500
Fire.

524
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,200
Load.

525
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,330
Fire.

526
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,370
Good morning, Mrs. Johnson.

527
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,410
Good morning.

528
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,620
Here.

529
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:51,830
Oh, yes.

530
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,500
Oh, Dr. Sun.

531
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,250
Yes?

532
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,580
It seems like there's something in today's paper about China.

533
00:35:58,910 --> 00:35:59,620
Thank you.

534
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,250
Do you need some help, Dr. Sun?

535
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,250
Can I give you some water?

536
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:35,250
I'm all right.

537
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:56,580
Yat-sen.

538
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,700
Hey, what's going on in here?

539
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,000
What are you guys doing?

540
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,660
Come on.

541
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:04,410
Yat-sen. The Revolution has succeeded.

542
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,290
- Hey, what's the matter with you? - Sorry.

543
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,410
On October 10,

544
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,700
The Revolutionary army took over Wuchang.

545
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,450
Governor Rui Cheng fled overnight.

546
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,910
Wuchang revolutionaries telegraphed the entire country,

547
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,370
asking them to join in the rebellion. The world's in shock.

548
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,080
Yat-sen,

549
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,330
you should return to China immediately.

550
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,790
I'll reserve a boat ticket for you.

551
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:23,290
You only need to spend 20 days across the Pacific, then you'll reach Shanghai.

552
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,700
It happened in Wuchang.

553
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:27,580
It happened in Wuchang.

554
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,620
Send a telegram to Keqiang in Hong Kong,

555
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:33,790
so he travels to Wuchang to lead the revolution.

556
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:34,540
Yes.

557
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:37,950
Sun,

558
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:39,120
I'm ready.

559
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,790
I'll go to China with you.

560
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,620
No.

561
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,700
I'm going to Europe first.

562
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,330
Huang Xing is much better than me to handle this in China.

563
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,120
Why?

564
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,500
The unrest in China

565
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:56,000
will be closely linked to the Four Nations Bank loan to the Qing court.

566
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,580
The court's out of money now,

567
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,120
but if they get the loan,

568
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,700
they can thwart the revolution.

569
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,500
Reserve tickets for Europe.

570
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:08,950
Zonghan,

571
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,000
don't bother making dinner.

572
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:11,120
We're running out of time.

573
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,700
Put it down.

574
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,040
Why are you so anxious?

575
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,910
You don't need it.

576
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,910
The battle in Wuchang will be intense.

577
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,080
I'm concerned for your safety.

578
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,910
What about your own safety?

579
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,500
Don't Worry,

580
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:44,660
I won't die.

581
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,950
Fate will be kind to me.

582
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,120
I should go now.

583
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:02,080
Go.

584
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:17,620
What happened?

585
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,790
Only yesterday Rui Cheng reported to us

586
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,910
that the rebel leaders were killed.

587
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,250
A day passed and...

588
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:24,950
The New Army had it easy.

589
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,290
Clearly,

590
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,500
the Wuchang regiments were sent to Sichuan to stop the unrest,

591
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,120
so the city was unguarded...

592
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:36,290
Tell me something I don't already know.

593
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,950
The Qing court has ruled for more than 200 years. We've ridden through many storms.

594
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,200
It's only a small flame, we'll extinguish it.

595
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,950
Who should we send

596
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,500
to extinguish this flame?

597
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:48,500
Empress Dowager,

598
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,200
I humbly believe...

599
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,330
I recommend Yin Chang, head of the Imperial Army.

600
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,660
This is his duty.

601
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,540
Xu Shichang.

602
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,410
Yes.

603
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,410
Just now,

604
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,080
what were you saying?

605
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,410
Yuan Shikai can fulfill this task.

606
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,160
Better to appoint Yin Chang.

607
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,120
This is family affair.

608
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:15,830
It's better to send over a Manchu.

609
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,160
Yes.

610
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,200
Empress Dowager,

611
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,160
I would like to submit a request.

612
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,620
Say it, Royal Prince.

613
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:29,160
Food and supplies precede an army.

614
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:29,790
There's this old saying...

615
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,750
Be precise,

616
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,700
- don't just quote the classics. - In my opinion,

617
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,450
We should finalize the loan

618
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,330
from the Four Nations Bank,

619
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,080
we'll have less to worry about later.

620
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,120
Haven't we discussed this for months?

621
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,870
Why hasn't this been done?

622
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,120
The Four Nations Bank felt

623
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:49,040
we've been indecisive

624
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,700
about mortgaging our railways.

625
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,370
There's been criticism outside.

626
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:54,750
People say that

627
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:57,160
we're giving away our sovereignty.

628
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,200
If we're not rulers here,

629
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:01,580
is this even a country?

630
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:04,830
General Li,

631
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,950
for the sake of the times, please decide.

632
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:09,040
I've treated you well.

633
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,080
Why are you making it so difficult for me?

634
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:12,950
We ask that you lead the Military Government.

635
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,500
We're not making it difficult.

636
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,040
Drop your gun.

637
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,700
Please ask him to drop his gun.

638
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,540
Put it down.

639
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,250
General Li,

640
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,870
you've treated us well.

641
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,080
We wish you'd lead the Military Government.

642
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:37,910
You nave great talents among the revolutionary ranks.

643
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,330
Why don't you ask Sun Wen to be your leader?

644
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,330
Li Yuanhong.

645
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:43,250
The revolutionary party will select our leaders.

646
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,700
At present.

647
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:45,750
Sun Wen is still abroad,

648
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,250
and Huang Keqiang is on his Way here.

649
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,750
That's why we offer you this.

650
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:49,790
Li Yuanhong,

651
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:50,910
do you understand your predicament?

652
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:52,500
I can give up my position in the Qing court,

653
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,790
but I don't want to become a revolutionary official.

654
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,080
I only want to return home.

655
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,870
You have no idea of the real situation:

656
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:02,250
Although Rui Cheng and Zhang Biao have gone into hiding,

657
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,500
if the court's troops were to counterattack,

658
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:07,660
they can destroy Wuchang in a second.

659
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:16,790
Come back.

660
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:17,790
Stop.

661
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,450
- Come back. - Go.

662
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,290
Stop.

663
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,950
Go.

664
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,660
Lie down.

665
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:36,450
Yin Chang's firing at us from a German battleship.

666
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:37,160
General Li,

667
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:38,120
are you all right?

668
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:39,660
What damned battle is this?

669
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,910
I'll die because of you.

670
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,500
Remove the ammunition, quick.

671
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,830
We'll die together.

672
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,580
We'll count you as a revolutionary martyr.

673
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,330
Li Yuanhong, General of the Mixed Brigade.

674
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:53,000
I'm Military Governor Li Yuanhong.

675
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,290
If you Want to live,

676
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:56,160
return to your stations.

677
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,870
Attention.

678
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:01,910
Yes.

679
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,790
Target: Battleship "Chuyu"

680
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:05,500
Target: Battleship "Chuyu"

681
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,410
Distance: 2400 feet.

682
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,500
Distance: 2400 feet.

683
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,000
Load.

684
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,830
Load.

685
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,830
Prepare for rapid firing, first round.

686
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,200
Rapid firing, first round.

687
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:17,830
Rapid firing, first round.

688
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:18,580
Fire.

689
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:19,700
Fire.

690
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:24,290
Distance:

691
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:26,160
2350 miles,

692
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:27,750
25° to the right.

693
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:29,040
Load.

694
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,580
Fire all three cannons.

695
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:31,200
Fire.

696
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:31,950
Fire.

697
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,410
Cease fire.

698
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,580
Why did we stop?

699
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,410
I'm the Military Governor,

700
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,370
I make all the decisions.

701
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:47,620
Why did they stop?

702
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:50,750
They ran out of ammunition?

703
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:51,540
Doesn't look like it.

704
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,000
Should we fire back to test them?

705
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,080
What for?

706
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,000
Better keep our lives. Run.

707
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,040
Run.

708
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,120
Even if we annihilate Yin Chang,

709
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:05,700
so what?

710
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:07,870
He's of no consequence.

711
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,080
The real battle is ahead of us.

712
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:11,580
Yes.

713
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:13,450
You want to cut my queue?

714
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,410
Fine.

715
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:15,450
Come.

716
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:24,080
Since you revolutionaries have bestowed such honour on me,

717
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,580
I'll be presumptuous and break the law.

718
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,410
Father.

719
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,000
Good news.

720
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,040
You scared away my fish.

721
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:53,450
You're coming out of seclusion.

722
00:45:58,370 --> 00:45:59,950
You can't hold your horses, can you?

723
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:24,660
General, Huafu is here.

724
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:28,290
Huafu.

725
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:30,000
Let's show

726
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:33,370
the revolutionaries and those in the Forbidden City

727
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:35,330
our great Beiyang Army

728
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,660
and our great power.

729
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:38,370
Yes.

730
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,330
Attention, artillery.

731
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,200
Target ahead,

732
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,250
25° to the right,

733
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,700
distance at 500.

734
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:47,330
Load.

735
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,910
Ready.

736
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:52,160
Fire.

737
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:22,200
Alcohol.

738
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,330
Keqiang.

739
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,870
Where should We go?

740
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,540
Wherever there's heavy gunfire.

741
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,410
Make way.

742
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:19,790
Make way.

743
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:26,080
Commander.

744
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,040
Avoid gunfire.

745
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:41,620
Avoid gunfire.

746
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,160
Hide in the trench with your squad.

747
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:44,250
Hide in the trench.

748
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,660
Hide in the trench.

749
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:56,870
Don't run.

750
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,330
Don't run.

751
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,200
Go back.

752
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:08,580
Don't run.

753
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,120
Retrieve the gun.

754
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:14,290
Remember,

755
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,870
alive soldier is useless

756
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:19,540
without his weapon.

757
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:22,910
Tell me, Huafu.

758
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:23,950
Tell me.

759
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:26,160
General,

760
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:29,660
We've taken.

761
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,120
Hankou.

762
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,290
Your order to Scorch

763
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:35,120
we attack Wuchang right away.

764
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:36,500
Now gives us access to Wu...

765
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,540
What's your next step?

766
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:41,870
Morale is high,

767
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,540
we attack Wuchang right away.

768
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:44,620
Great.

769
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,330
We take Hankou first,

770
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,660
then attack Beijing.

771
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:48,790
We'll conquer the world.

772
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:50,000
Sit down, have some food.

773
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,040
This is a Heaven-sent opportunity.

774
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,330
Sit down.

775
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:20,200
Keding,

776
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,700
you're cutting to the quick.

777
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Let's wait on.

778
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:28,830
Wuchang.

779
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,580
After the rabbit is killed,

780
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,370
the hunting dog will be cooked.

781
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:42,500
Enemy positions nave advanced.

782
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:44,000
Once they cover their firing range,

783
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,200
the infantry will attack.

784
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,580
The key to combat is to avoid gunfire.

785
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:48,410
Yes.

786
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:50,660
Idiot,

787
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:52,080
trying to run away? I'll kill you.

788
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:53,160
Drop your gun.

789
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,450
He's Huang Xing, our Commander.

790
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:58,540
Salute.

791
00:50:59,080 --> 00:50:59,950
I command you all:

792
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:00,870
From now on,

793
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:01,620
follow my orders.

794
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:02,370
Yes.

795
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,450
Always be prepared to enter the frontlines.

796
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:08,200
Yes.

797
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:16,080
We torched Hankou well,

798
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:17,750
it was a great offense.

799
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:20,620
But now,

800
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,620
we won't follow up.

801
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:31,660
If the revolutionaries can be easily defeated,

802
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:33,750
the country still belongs to the Qing court.

803
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,540
If the Qing court is also weak,

804
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,750
the revolutionaries could seize power.

805
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:39,290
Somehow,

806
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,200
we must be get a share of it.

807
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,750
Here's my condition:

808
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:49,290
I take full power over the army and its supplies.

809
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:50,540
Now.

810
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:54,500
Empress Dowager Longyu and the princes must Know that

811
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:57,790
they either get the loan from the Four Nations Bank,

812
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:00,370
or there'll be no more battle.

813
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:05,830
Regarding the revolutionaries...

814
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:07,950
Should we Contact Li Yuanhong and test the waters?

815
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:09,540
He's not a revolutionary.

816
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:14,200
In the long run,

817
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,950
we should find someone we can connect with.

818
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:19,910
Sun Yat-sen and Huang Xing.

819
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:21,000
Reporting to the General.

820
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:22,540
Wang Jingwei is here.

821
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,040
Please.

822
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:32,370
Isn't Wang

823
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:34,540
supposed to be in Beijing, in prison?

824
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:37,410
Zaifeng released him.

825
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:39,830
You were locked up for a year.

826
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,830
You've suffered.

827
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,120
Times have changed, don't mention it any more.

828
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:48,830
I treasure you most among the revolutionaries.

829
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,080
I was just telling Keding,

830
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:54,250
we should swear as blood brothers.

831
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:56,700
Zhaoming,

832
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:58,540
tell me.

833
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:01,910
What do the revolutionaries want?

834
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:03,950
We Want to establish a republic.

835
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:05,790
Republic?

836
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:10,000
But Why?

837
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:11,500
Feudalism has kept China

838
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:13,370
back for far too long.

839
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:14,410
As long as there's an Emperor,

840
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:16,580
we cannot rid ourselves of the old system.

841
00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:17,500
The Revolution must

842
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:19,080
depose the Emperor

843
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:20,540
and the imperial system.

844
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,950
That's all theory.

845
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,540
We have to put it in practice.

846
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:25,370
When the Republic is established,

847
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,580
who will lead it?

848
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,700
A leader of the Republic is elected by all citizens.

849
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:38,870
Zhaoming.

850
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:41,290
The General pondered seriously

851
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:42,700
before inviting you from Beijing.

852
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,410
He'd like your help.

853
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:46,750
You're the one who knows

854
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,040
the revolutionaries well.

855
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:49,660
Zhaoming

856
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:53,160
ls Sun Wen still abroad?

857
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:18,620
Gentlemen.

858
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:19,870
Gentlemen,

859
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:21,250
you know who I am

860
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:22,330
and Why I'm here.

861
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,540
It seems to me

862
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:25,870
that you have decided that you're against the revolution.

863
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,330
Am I right?

864
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,410
Go.

865
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:36,750
If that's the case,

866
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:39,120
the Qing government will take this loan,

867
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:41,290
buy guns and shoot through

868
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:43,000
the hearts of revolutionaries.

869
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:45,870
Your money will support the corrupt Qing government,

870
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,540
in exchange for What?

871
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:48,660
Railway?

872
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:49,950
Our railway.

873
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:50,790
Sir.

874
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:51,750
Sir,

875
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:53,790
please keep your voice down.

876
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:56,580
You're deciding the future of my country here.

877
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:57,950
Being a Chinese,

878
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,870
I have the right to know what's going on here.

879
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:02,410
We've already informed your government

880
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:04,200
regarding our decision.

881
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:07,040
You must tell me your decision.

882
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:09,910
Let me remind you that we're in Europe.

883
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,870
You really should behave like a gentleman.

884
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,950
Do you understand what's happening in China now?

885
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,160
Mr. Sun Wen.

886
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:20,540
He won't answer.

887
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:22,000
They are bankers,

888
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,910
they only care about their money,

889
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,660
not other people's fate.

890
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,120
Mr. Hillier,

891
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,830
do you know who he is?

892
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:30,790
No.

893
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,950
He's the man who will decide the future of China.

894
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:40,160
Who are you?

895
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:41,160
Tang Manrou.

896
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:42,160
Idiot.

897
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:44,040
Your father is the Chinese Imperial Ambassador,

898
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:45,830
and you spoke for Sun Wen?

899
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,330
Do you know who he is?

900
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:50,700
Who is he?

901
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:53,660
He's a traitor of the Qing Dynasty.

902
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,290
He's a wanted criminal.

903
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:00,750
He's a revolutionary.

904
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:02,700
Don't you know?

905
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:05,620
Tang Manrou.

906
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,790
I know who he is,

907
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,250
that's why I helped him.

908
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:28,750
Mr. Hillier.

909
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,750
Hillier.

910
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,000
I must go before this person arrives.

911
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:35,040
We cannot be present in the same place.

912
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:36,870
Why leave, Minister Tang?

913
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,290
I beg you, you still haven't done us

914
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:41,500
the honour of accepting our invitation.

915
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:43,870
You really mustn't leave.

916
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:47,580
Please. Don't leave.

917
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:50,080
Ladies and Gentlemen:

918
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:53,040
I'm well aware that I've come here uninvited.

919
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,410
However,

920
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:58,000
as the leader of the Chinese revolution, I only ask you,

921
00:56:58,370 --> 00:57:00,410
please reconsider the 6 million pounds,

922
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:02,160
your loan to the Qing government.

923
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:03,120
Sun Wen,

924
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:04,910
you're a subject of the Qing Dynasty,

925
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,910
yet you show no respect for your country.

926
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,790
How can you claim any respect regarding our country?

927
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,000
You've lost it all a long time ago.

928
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:16,540
I represent the Whole Chinese people,

929
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:20,040
and speak in the name as leader of the Chinese revolution.

930
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:20,910
Dr. Sun,

931
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:21,660
we will not break

932
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:23,620
such an important business contract.

933
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:24,580
Mr. Thompson,

934
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,290
this is not a business contract,

935
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:28,160
it's a political deal.

936
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,620
If this contract is signed, what's at stake here

937
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:33,290
is Chinese sovereignty.

938
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,120
Mr. Sun,

939
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:36,870
our German banks only care about business,

940
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,080
we don't care about domestic politics.

941
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:42,160
My dearest German delegates,

942
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:46,120
every time the Qing government fires a gun at us,

943
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,330
your money presses the trigger.

944
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:51,910
The Qing government will buy weapons with your loan, nothing else.

945
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,540
Perhaps you've misunderstood.

946
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,910
According to my understanding, this loan is intended to help rebuild the railways.

947
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:58,290
Mr. Sun,

948
00:57:58,540 --> 00:57:59,950
our minister in Peking,

949
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,290
Sir John Newell Jordan,

950
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:02,790
said the same thing about the loan.

951
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:04,000
Dear Sir Buchanan,

952
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,750
I believe when Mr. Jordan realizes

953
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:10,500
that the money is used to destroy the Chinese revolution,

954
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:11,910
he will change his mind.

955
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:12,950
Sun Wen.

956
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,370
This is my second warning.

957
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:16,160
Do not defame the Qing Dynasty here.

958
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:17,330
Defame?

959
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:19,040
Minister Tang,

960
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:20,620
how you underestimated us.

961
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:23,120
We Want to depose you and the court.

962
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,660
Gentlemen,

963
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:26,790
we all know that to give good money

964
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:28,290
to a bad client

965
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:29,750
is a fatal mistake.

966
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:33,250
The Qing government is like a patient diagnosed with cancer.

967
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:35,410
Your loan is like sugar pills,

968
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,290
it'll only make him feel better,

969
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,330
but the fate is sealed.

970
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,870
It seems that you are quite pessimistic about the future in China.

971
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,540
No, I'm not.

972
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,040
On the contrary,

973
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,540
my vision of the new China

974
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:48,500
is very positive.

975
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:52,040
I see huge miles covered with natural resources.

976
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:54,700
I see thousands of banks providing new capital.

977
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:58,540
I see a mountain of railways connecting all the modern communities.

978
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,040
Gentlemen,

979
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:02,200
you are bankers,

980
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:05,120
you should know to invest your money wisely.

981
00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:07,790
Would you rather invest your money

982
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,540
into a dying government or the emerging one?

983
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:13,120
Mr. Sun Yat-sen,

984
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:15,700
I know you are the leader of this revolution,

985
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:17,540
and I respect your revolution.

986
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:21,790
However, we cannot invest money against the interests of our own nation.

987
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:23,080
You may know that

988
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,200
I'm a surgeon.

989
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,750
As a doctor, my duty

990
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,910
is to save my patient's life.

991
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:30,250
One day

992
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,040
I found my country

993
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:33,790
is suffering cancer.

994
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:35,870
Mr. Hillier,

995
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:38,080
The situation of China

996
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:40,660
is like this roast lamb,

997
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:43,580
it's unlikely our people

998
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:45,660
would enjoy freedom,

999
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:46,950
equality

1000
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,410
and fraternity.

1001
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:50,790
Yes,

1002
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:52,410
that is to say,

1003
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,200
this is China.

1004
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,750
And all of you Want a piece.

1005
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,080
Germany

1006
00:59:58,370 --> 00:59:59,370
here's your piece,

1007
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:01,750
the Shandong peninsula.

1008
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:07,410
Good location, isn't it?

1009
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:09,540
What's all this?

1010
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:10,620
Sir Buchanan,

1011
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:11,700
your piece,

1012
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,330
left rather small on this plate:

1013
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:16,000
Only Hong Kong,

1014
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:17,450
and you know very well,

1015
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:18,750
this is a gate

1016
01:00:19,290 --> 01:00:20,750
to reach China.

1017
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:24,790
Mr. Thompson, let me out out a special piece for you,

1018
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,450
in memory of all those Chinese lives

1019
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:32,910
that were lost carving out your mountain for the transcontinental railway

1020
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:38,870
where they sleep, buried, the bones of Chinese labourers.

1021
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:39,830
It's a pity,

1022
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:42,910
all those countries not here today:

1023
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:44,000
Russia,

1024
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:45,910
Japan and Portugal.

1025
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,290
They want Pescadores, Liaodong Peninsula

1026
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:49,450
and Macau.

1027
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:51,660
Gentlemen,

1028
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:53,000
this

1029
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:56,660
is the last time you can gather to feast on China.

1030
01:00:57,410 --> 01:00:58,370
I really hope

1031
01:00:58,540 --> 01:00:59,950
I made my point clear.

1032
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:02,950
Mr. Tang,

1033
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,700
please wait a moment. Please.

1034
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:06,330
Go home.

1035
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:08,200
Please.

1036
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:10,000
Please stay.

1037
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,200
Stay.

1038
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:20,950
Here it is.

1039
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:24,660
Please tell me, what does Revolution mean?

1040
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:26,370
Like a doctor who heals patients,

1041
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,370
a revolution saves an entire people.

1042
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,000
Mr. Sun,

1043
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:32,750
I heard girls in China

1044
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:34,700
have to bound their feet from young age.

1045
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:36,000
Is it painful?

1046
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:38,790
Yes, it's painful

1047
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:40,120
but

1048
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:41,950
it will be gone very soon.

1049
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,790
I see. Thank you.

1050
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:48,000
Must people

1051
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,370
lose their lives in revolution?

1052
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,160
The final goal of revolution isn't death,

1053
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,330
but to change fate.

1054
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:56,410
Young people sacrificed themselves for the revolution,

1055
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:59,580
so those living can lead better lives.

1056
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:41,750
Extend firing range.

1057
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:46,910
Come.

1058
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:49,790
It's overheated. It won't fire.

1059
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,040
Go, piss.

1060
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:20,410
Lie down.

1061
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:22,750
Lie down.

1062
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:31,500
Nurse.

1063
01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:36,500
Little Hubei,

1064
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:37,620
gather hand grenades.

1065
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:44,540
Give them to me.

1066
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:45,950
- Give them to me. - No.

1067
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,000
Let go.

1068
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:49,040
- Commander. - Let go.

1069
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,000
Don't pull me back.

1070
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:51,620
Don't pull me back.

1071
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:53,120
Let go.

1072
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:54,080
Let go.

1073
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:56,540
Go.

1074
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:57,950
Little Hubei.

1075
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:04,750
Ammunition handler.

1076
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:12,620
Charge.

1077
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:14,160
General,

1078
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:15,540
Huafu is here.

1079
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:18,250
General,

1080
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:19,910
We've taken Hanyang.

1081
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,410
Should we continue fighting?

1082
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:24,700
There's

1083
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:27,040
no need to be in such a rush.

1084
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:28,700
We nave to let the Qing court understand,

1085
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:30,540
if they don't pay up,

1086
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:32,950
we won't move.

1087
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:38,830
Your words mean...

1088
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,370
Can't you read?

1089
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:41,580
Read it yourself.

1090
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:43,660
Fight slowly,

1091
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:45,200
wait and see?

1092
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:49,450
- But morale is high. - I must return to Beijing

1093
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:51,750
and see what the Empress Dowager says.

1094
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,660
Let me tell you my bottom line:

1095
01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:57,250
If the court

1096
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,830
doesn't give me enough money,

1097
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:02,250
I won't fight.

1098
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:06,000
I'd thought it'd be easy to defeat them,

1099
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:08,540
but Sun's rebels

1100
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:10,660
are resilient.

1101
01:08:11,410 --> 01:08:15,120
I also lack ammunition and supplies.

1102
01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:17,040
Empress Dowager,

1103
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:19,580
I was forced to cease

1104
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:21,450
the battle of Wuchang.

1105
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:22,500
Yuan Shikai.

1106
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:23,580
Yes, Empress Dowager.

1107
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:26,040
How much do you need?

1108
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:28,790
Tell me.

1109
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:32,910
If I have12 million taels of gold,

1110
01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:39,040
I can finish off the revolutionaries

1111
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,370
within a few months.

1112
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,120
If we have no money for battle,

1113
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,250
we only have one choice:

1114
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:48,830
To make peace with the revolutionaries.

1115
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,040
You dare?

1116
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,410
Making peace means we acknowledge them.

1117
01:08:54,040 --> 01:08:55,410
The Beiyang Army is on its

1118
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:57,910
last round of ammunition.

1119
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,250
I'll never agree to

1120
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:00,910
your making peace.

1121
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:02,870
If you really care about the Qing court,

1122
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:06,620
do something useful, donate your riches.

1123
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,450
Why don't you donate your own money to the cause?

1124
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:11,370
Yuan Shikai.

1125
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:15,580
Empress Dowager,

1126
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:17,910
as I had reported earlier,

1127
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:21,160
we must have enough money to support the army.

1128
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:24,250
Yuan Shikai is indeed hard pressed.

1129
01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:42,580
You love to argue

1130
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:45,120
all the time,

1131
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:47,700
pretending to be loyal ministers.

1132
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:49,370
Now

1133
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:51,660
in times of crisis,

1134
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:55,620
you've all become selfish.

1135
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:57,660
The dynasty is destined to fall.

1136
01:09:58,950 --> 01:09:59,660
Your servant

1137
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,790
will give up all of his possessions.

1138
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:03,750
This is a time of crisis, I will lead

1139
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:05,950
my entire family to protect the country.

1140
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:06,500
Your servant

1141
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:07,750
doesn't want a coffin,

1142
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:09,750
nor does he care about his ancestral grave.

1143
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:12,450
If money can help destroy the rebels,

1144
01:10:12,660 --> 01:10:13,200
then

1145
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:14,950
I'll leave everything and

1146
01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:17,790
return to my home village.

1147
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:21,660
The Four Nations Bank has been persuaded by Sun,

1148
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,160
I'm afraid we won't receive

1149
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:26,080
a cent of this loan.

1150
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:29,500
I know.

1151
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:32,500
Heaven will punish.

1152
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:34,790
Sun Wen for this.

1153
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:35,790
Empress Dowager,

1154
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:38,000
even though we run out of money, food,

1155
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:39,830
and ammunition,

1156
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,000
we still have for centuries

1157
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:44,120
our loyal subjects.

1158
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:45,830
I only have this to say:

1159
01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:49,000
I will die for the Qing Dynasty.

1160
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:03,120
Sun Wen, your interference...

1161
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:04,910
with the Four Nations Bank loan

1162
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,200
has generated controversy in China.

1163
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:10,580
This is the Prince Regents order to assassinate you.

1164
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:15,700
This one

1165
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:17,000
looks more like

1166
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:18,790
a portrait of the deceased.

1167
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:21,080
I don't agree with you,

1168
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,040
but I respect your courage.

1169
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:25,660
I won't Kill you.

1170
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,450
I want to persuade you.

1171
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:35,120
Sun Wen, we are both past middle age.

1172
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:36,500
Confucius said,

1173
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:38,830
At 50, I knew my destiny.

1174
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:40,950
He also said,

1175
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:42,540
At 40, I am not deluded.

1176
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,120
I've never wavered

1177
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:45,950
from my beliefs.

1178
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:48,660
I know Why you won't Kill me.

1179
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:50,870
You're a father,

1180
01:12:51,290 --> 01:12:52,040
you know

1181
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,790
the Qing court you serve

1182
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,120
will eventually destroy your children.

1183
01:12:56,950 --> 01:12:58,790
We all want a strong and bright China

1184
01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:01,450
for our children.

1185
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:04,250
Go,

1186
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:06,040
I don't want to see you again.

1187
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:08,000
Mr. Jordan,

1188
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:11,500
you're the first guest in my new house.

1189
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:12,700
Now that you've moved to Beijing,

1190
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:14,660
we can see each other more often.

1191
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:15,500
Yes.

1192
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:17,910
I don't intend to leave the city this time.

1193
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:22,000
How's the situation in the South?

1194
01:13:22,330 --> 01:13:23,000
Difficult.

1195
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:26,950
Sun Wen and Huang Xing are southern barbarians with big appetites.

1196
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,160
You could have conquered Wuchang,

1197
01:13:30,330 --> 01:13:31,660
but you stopped.

1198
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:33,160
We all knew

1199
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:34,870
the Qing Dynasty has run out of money,

1200
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,250
the end is near.

1201
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:38,160
You want to profit from the power balance

1202
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:40,700
between the Qing court and the revolutionary army.

1203
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,250
So now you want peace.

1204
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:45,870
What do you think

1205
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,620
of this balance between my left and right hands?

1206
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,040
Truth be told, I'm very impressed.

1207
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,200
But the revolutionaries won't talk to me.

1208
01:13:57,910 --> 01:14:01,750
Now I understand. Would you like us to extend a hand?

1209
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:05,330
You...

1210
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:13,660
We'll pave the way for you to negotiate peace with the revolutionaries.

1211
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,790
It's not good for anyone if fighting continues.

1212
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,370
What's most important now is holding onto power.

1213
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:20,790
Real power.

1214
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,540
I'm looking for a collaborator

1215
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:25,700
to protect the interests of Britain in China.

1216
01:14:27,450 --> 01:14:29,500
Well, you've found him.

1217
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:33,040
Military Governor, let me explain.

1218
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:34,910
I sent Keqiang to Shanghai

1219
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:38,000
because of the overall strategy of the revolutionary movement.

1220
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,040
I don't understand.

1221
01:14:39,330 --> 01:14:40,080
The Wuchang uprising attracted

1222
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:41,290
the world's attention.

1223
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:42,580
Isn't that also part of the overall strategy?

1224
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:44,700
Since we can attack Nanjing, why can't we defend Wuchang'?

1225
01:14:44,870 --> 01:14:45,580
In Wuchang,

1226
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:47,620
we're in a stalemate with the Beiyang Army.

1227
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:50,250
Our trainee soliders have suffered heavy casualties.

1228
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:51,950
In Nanjing,

1229
01:14:52,290 --> 01:14:53,330
the enemy is weak.

1230
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:55,290
Our plan is to attack Nanjing, than retake Wuchang.

1231
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:56,330
'That's our overall strategy.

1232
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,540
This is the decision made by the Tongmenghui.

1233
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:00,580
I must abide by it.

1234
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:03,790
Fine. Whatever you say.

1235
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:05,870
But I won't go to Shanghai.

1236
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:07,750
Please understand,

1237
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,790
it hasn't been easy to forge our paths together.

1238
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:12,450
My home is here.

1239
01:15:12,750 --> 01:15:13,500
My power base is here.

1240
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:14,580
Military Governor Li,

1241
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,750
it appears we won't be sharing

1242
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:19,120
the same path.

1243
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:24,540
My child, don't move.

1244
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:26,120
Don't move.

1245
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:27,450
Lie down.

1246
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:29,370
Listen,

1247
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:30,250
if you want to live,

1248
01:15:30,410 --> 01:15:31,410
we must amputate your leg.

1249
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:32,450
Can you hear me?

1250
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,040
Alcohol.

1251
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:45,580
It's fine.

1252
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:49,830
Ready?

1253
01:15:52,370 --> 01:15:54,000
- Be brave. - We begin now.

1254
01:16:02,830 --> 01:16:04,160
Listen to me.

1255
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,250
Listen to me.

1256
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:14,750
Stop.

1257
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:17,500
Stop.

1258
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:25,450
Come.

1259
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:26,830
Take him away.

1260
01:16:59,000 --> 01:16:59,950
You've said it before.

1261
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:01,580
So we failed.

1262
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,870
Haven't we failed before?

1263
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:07,500
I'm talking to you.

1264
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:14,000
Idiot.

1265
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:40,580
Mr. Sun,

1266
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:42,620
telegram from England for you.

1267
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:43,750
Okay,

1268
01:17:44,450 --> 01:17:45,120
here you are.

1269
01:17:45,410 --> 01:17:46,370
Thank you.

1270
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:49,830
Mr. Sun,

1271
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:52,910
I must inform you right away.

1272
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:56,450
The Four Nations Bank decided to hold off

1273
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,290
on the loan to the Qing government.

1274
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:03,040
You once told me that.

1275
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:04,660
Revolution is life,

1276
01:18:05,250 --> 01:18:06,660
not only living,

1277
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:07,950
but fate.

1278
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:11,200
I don't understand Revolution,

1279
01:18:11,950 --> 01:18:14,950
but I've struggled and fought, I was angry.

1280
01:18:15,870 --> 01:18:17,540
I also knew,

1281
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:19,830
I'd end up as sacrifice

1282
01:18:20,250 --> 01:18:22,500
along with my father.

1283
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:26,950
I wish your Revolution,

1284
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:28,160
I'1O,

1285
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:30,120
wish our Revolution,

1286
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:32,290
every SUCCESS.

1287
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,250
Yat-sen.

1288
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:46,580
Yat-sen.

1289
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:48,330
Keqiang.

1290
01:18:49,620 --> 01:18:50,410
Where are you?

1291
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:51,450
Keqiang

1292
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:52,500
I'm here.

1293
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:53,410
Can you hear me?

1294
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:54,450
I can.

1295
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:55,500
Where are you?

1296
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:59,080
Huang Keqiang.

1297
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,500
Yat-sen.

1298
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:04,410
I'm starboard.

1299
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:06,000
Me too.

1300
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:41,540
Keqiang.

1301
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:45,040
At the Welcome ceremony,

1302
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:46,700
you have to put on

1303
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:48,450
the revolutionary army uniform.

1304
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:49,370
Yes.

1305
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:54,040
Yat-sen.

1306
01:19:54,250 --> 01:19:55,870
Binglin, you're all here.

1307
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:57,700
Not in first class?

1308
01:19:57,870 --> 01:19:59,000
- No. - Second class?

1309
01:19:59,160 --> 01:19:59,540
No.

1310
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:01,410
Yat-sen.

1311
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,580
It saved my life once.

1312
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:06,500
Keqiang,

1313
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:07,700
your hand.

1314
01:20:08,910 --> 01:20:09,910
Guangzhou uprising.

1315
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,080
Doesn't matter.

1316
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:17,910
Yat-sen.

1317
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:18,950
Mr. Sun.

1318
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:20,120
Dunchu.

1319
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:21,830
You're here.

1320
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,580
Yat-sen, we searched all the way to the beam.

1321
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:25,950
You're all here.

1322
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:27,910
A hug.

1323
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:32,250
Let's go.

1324
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:34,080
Yat-sen, we waited so long for your return.

1325
01:20:34,290 --> 01:20:35,660
Shiping, you haven't aged a bit.

1326
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:52,500
Mr. Sun,

1327
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:54,040
after your ship departed from Europe,

1328
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,040
on your journey back,

1329
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,660
what thoughts came over you?

1330
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:59,040
After 16 years of tribulations,

1331
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:00,700
I've returned to my motherland.

1332
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:01,450
Mr. Sun,

1333
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:03,450
we hear you've returned with huge donations,

1334
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:04,370
ls that true?

1335
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:05,700
I don't have any money.

1336
01:21:05,870 --> 01:21:07,870
All I bring is the Revolutionary spirit.

1337
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:10,330
What is the ultimate goal of the Revolution?

1338
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:11,540
The goals of the Revolution are simple:

1339
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,700
We overthrow imperial rule

1340
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:13,830
and save our people.

1341
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:14,700
Mr. Sun,

1342
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:16,790
what did you tell

1343
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:17,830
those bankers in Europe?

1344
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:18,910
I told them,

1345
01:21:19,450 --> 01:21:21,330
it's the Chinese people

1346
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:22,580
who'll steer the fate of China,

1347
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:23,620
not foreigners

1348
01:21:23,790 --> 01:21:25,450
or Manchu royalty.

1349
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:27,410
Mr. Sun, the north and south are now negotiating peace.

1350
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:28,750
What is your opinion?

1351
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:30,200
My opinion is this:

1352
01:21:30,410 --> 01:21:32,830
We haven't reached our Revolutionary goal, we won't negotiate.

1353
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:38,830
Tie up them.

1354
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,500
Our position is that

1355
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:51,870
unless the Emperor abdicates,

1356
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:53,910
there'll be no peace agreement.

1357
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,080
Our position is that

1358
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:57,080
the monarchical system cannot change.

1359
01:23:07,830 --> 01:23:09,290
This is a family dinner. Shaochuan,

1360
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:11,000
you're part of the family.

1361
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:16,660
Come, try this.

1362
01:23:17,870 --> 01:23:19,330
A specialty from home.

1363
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:21,040
Lotus root with glutinous rice.

1364
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,500
Come, sit.

1365
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:27,540
General,

1366
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:28,620
this is.

1367
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:32,080
To thank you.

1368
01:23:32,330 --> 01:23:34,830
You put in so much effort in the negotiations.

1369
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:36,000
You've worked so hard.

1370
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:38,000
Please tell me

1371
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:39,620
what's on your mind.

1372
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,290
You're the only one among Us

1373
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:42,910
who knew Sun Wen.

1374
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:44,500
I want to know more about.

1375
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:45,870
Sun Wen.

1376
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:48,500
What type of a man is he?

1377
01:23:48,830 --> 01:23:49,950
Zhang Shizhao said,

1378
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,870
China will rise because of Sun,

1379
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:55,620
he's the person

1380
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:58,120
who'll revive the country.

1381
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:01,660
Miyazaki considers Sun

1382
01:24:01,830 --> 01:24:03,540
a hero who will save China.

1383
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:07,700
Kang Youwei claimed Sun is illiterate.

1384
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:10,540
Wu Zhihui says that Sun is a hardworking scholar.

1385
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:12,660
Some say he's like Robin Hood,

1386
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:14,080
an outlaw.

1387
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:16,540
Some say he's a real scholar,

1388
01:24:16,700 --> 01:24:19,660
an itinerant doctor holding a scalpel.

1389
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:22,830
Others call him

1390
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:25,370
a good-for-nothing liar.

1391
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:28,660
There are many versions.

1392
01:24:29,790 --> 01:24:30,330
Shaochuan,

1393
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,410
he has so many followers.

1394
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:37,000
How does he do it?

1395
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:39,160
I did hear this from many people:

1396
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:41,000
That Sun

1397
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:43,330
is selfless.

1398
01:25:10,910 --> 01:25:12,330
A selfless person?

1399
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,450
Where in the world can We find one?

1400
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:16,700
It's been 2000 years,

1401
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:18,330
we can't wait any longer for.

1402
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:19,700
- China's first Republic. - Representatives from

1403
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:20,700
the 17 provinces have decided

1404
01:25:20,870 --> 01:25:22,040
not to elect a President, but to elect a Grand Marshal.

1405
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:24,120
Mr. Sun, please sign.

1406
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:26,160
A Grand Marshal cannot be head of state.

1407
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:27,870
We must elect a President.

1408
01:25:28,370 --> 01:25:28,910
On the Presidential election,

1409
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,700
should we wait to hear from Yuan Shikai?

1410
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:33,120
If he can really hasten the Emperor's abdication...

1411
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:36,330
The negotiating parties already made a pact.

1412
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,200
Whoever first deposes the Qing government will become President.

1413
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:39,950
Yuan Shikai hasn't deposed the Qing court.

1414
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,200
We didn't break our promise.

1415
01:25:41,540 --> 01:25:42,580
It you insist on a Presidential election,

1416
01:25:42,750 --> 01:25:44,330
people will use that as an excuse to resume fighting.

1417
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:45,250
So what?

1418
01:25:45,410 --> 01:25:47,370
We fought and look what we've achieved today.

1419
01:25:47,540 --> 01:25:48,080
Keqiang.

1420
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:50,370
If we resume fighting, what are our chances of winning?

1421
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:52,450
We have no money,

1422
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:53,870
morale is low,

1423
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:55,910
we have no sure chance of winning.

1424
01:25:56,330 --> 01:25:57,410
How can we fight?

1425
01:25:57,620 --> 01:25:58,290
This is impractical.

1426
01:25:58,450 --> 01:25:59,790
When the revolutionary army had nothing,

1427
01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:01,250
we were willing to sacrifice our lives.

1428
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:02,830
Now we have half a country,

1429
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:03,950
what are We afraid of?

1430
01:26:04,370 --> 01:26:06,040
The international community nee expressed support for Yuan Shikai.

1431
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:08,830
Overseas Chinese all hope that we could setup e government as soon as possible

1432
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:09,830
and elect a President.

1433
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,000
To be safe,

1434
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:13,080
I think we should wait.

1435
01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:15,200
If Yuan doesn't depose the Emperor for another 100 years,

1436
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:16,700
do we still wait?

1437
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:19,410
Let's put pressure on him, now.

1438
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:20,950
If Yuan makes the Emperor abdicate,

1439
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:22,540
do we have to keep our promise?

1440
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:24,660
Even if Yuan makes the Emperor abdicate,

1441
01:26:24,790 --> 01:26:26,500
he isn't qualified to be President.

1442
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:27,660
Not true.

1443
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,660
If Yuan keeps his promise,

1444
01:26:30,330 --> 01:26:31,660
he can become President.

1445
01:26:32,790 --> 01:26:34,450
If you've promised him anyway, why bother holding an election?

1446
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:37,000
Good question.

1447
01:26:39,290 --> 01:26:40,950
It's Worth it.

1448
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:42,910
First,

1449
01:26:43,450 --> 01:26:44,500
we have to establish

1450
01:26:44,660 --> 01:26:46,120
the concept of a Republic.

1451
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:47,790
It's just like building a road

1452
01:26:47,950 --> 01:26:49,200
in the wilderness,

1453
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:51,750
so the Revolution can continue its path.

1454
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:53,410
In future, in China,

1455
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:55,790
no one can turn back.

1456
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:58,910
Lie down.

1457
01:27:01,410 --> 01:27:02,120
Against the wall.

1458
01:27:02,290 --> 01:27:03,700
All of you.

1459
01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:07,580
Against the wall.

1460
01:27:07,870 --> 01:27:08,620
Against the wall.

1461
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:14,080
He's the assassin.

1462
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:18,410
Release him.

1463
01:27:21,330 --> 01:27:22,790
Who sent you here?

1464
01:27:24,450 --> 01:27:25,870
Sun Wen is a sinner,

1465
01:27:26,250 --> 01:27:28,330
he's corrupt,

1466
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:29,870
he's sullied the Qing dynasty,

1467
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:31,750
he's immoral,

1468
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:34,000
he misleads the people,

1469
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:35,790
he's beyond pardon.

1470
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,160
Everyone can kill him.

1471
01:27:40,910 --> 01:27:42,160
It's no use interrogating him.

1472
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,790
We live in entirely different worlds.

1473
01:27:45,250 --> 01:27:45,870
Yes.

1474
01:27:46,830 --> 01:27:47,790
Two days ago,

1475
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:50,200
on December 27,

1476
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:52,950
provincial representatives voted

1477
01:27:53,830 --> 01:27:55,370
and approved

1478
01:27:55,830 --> 01:27:59,330
the Provisional Government Organizational Draft.

1479
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:03,540
They also approved the Presidential system

1480
01:28:03,910 --> 01:28:04,750
as well as

1481
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,540
the nomination of candidates.

1482
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:08,540
Elections will take place

1483
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,790
today, December 29,

1484
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:13,620
for the position of.

1485
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:15,250
Provisional President.

1486
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:17,660
I declare

1487
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:20,540
each of the 17 provinces,

1488
01:28:21,250 --> 01:28:23,120
though some with more representatives than others,

1489
01:28:23,330 --> 01:28:25,160
is only given one vote.

1490
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:29,080
A candidate receiving more the two-thirds of the votes

1491
01:28:29,330 --> 01:28:31,370
will become Provisional President.

1492
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:33,830
Those in favor, raise their hands.

1493
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:38,040
This is the Presidential ballot.

1494
01:28:38,830 --> 01:28:41,200
Your decision is crucial.

1495
01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:44,870
We hope you will not disappoint your people

1496
01:28:45,410 --> 01:28:47,080
in your choice.

1497
01:28:50,410 --> 01:28:51,410
Please fill in your ballot.

1498
01:29:16,790 --> 01:29:17,790
Homer.

1499
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:20,500
Sun.

1500
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:23,080
What are you doing here?

1501
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:26,410
The Presidential election is ongoing in the conference hall.

1502
01:29:26,910 --> 01:29:28,200
I'm one of the candidates.

1503
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:30,950
History,

1504
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:32,750
you're making history.

1505
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,620
I'm witnessing history.

1506
01:29:35,290 --> 01:29:37,370
I'm standing right beside history.

1507
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:38,620
For thousands of years,

1508
01:29:38,950 --> 01:29:42,370
in Chinese history, we the people

1509
01:29:42,750 --> 01:29:44,200
never received the opportunity to

1510
01:29:44,370 --> 01:29:46,120
elect the head of government.

1511
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:47,790
Never.

1512
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:49,290
That

1513
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:51,160
is what we've been fighting for.

1514
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:54,120
Our people have been fighting ongoing for so long.

1515
01:29:54,330 --> 01:29:55,830
And now we've finally done it.

1516
01:29:59,160 --> 01:29:59,790
Homer,

1517
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:01,450
when did you get here?

1518
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:04,790
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

1519
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:07,080
Now, as head of the Assembly...

1520
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:08,450
I must be there.

1521
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:10,410
I declare the results.

1522
01:30:10,870 --> 01:30:12,200
Out of a total of 17 votes,

1523
01:30:12,580 --> 01:30:14,040
Sun Wen received 16.

1524
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:17,410
The Provisional President of the Republic of China is.

1525
01:30:18,330 --> 01:30:19,160
Sun Wen.

1526
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:20,450
Dr. Sun,

1527
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:21,620
I heard your name.

1528
01:30:22,200 --> 01:30:22,950
I told you,

1529
01:30:23,450 --> 01:30:26,000
you'd be China's first President.

1530
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,500
Tang Shaoyi,

1531
01:30:48,290 --> 01:30:51,250
didn't you say he's selfless?

1532
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:53,750
What an slap in the face.

1533
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:01,870
General.

1534
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:06,540
Go.

1535
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:12,080
Order.

1536
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:14,080
Feng Guozhang and Duan Qirui

1537
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:16,200
to issue a joint telegram against the Republic.

1538
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:20,410
Tang Shaoyi is sympathetic to the Republic, unable to fulfill his duties,

1539
01:31:20,870 --> 01:31:22,790
he's dismissed as representative to the negotiations.

1540
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:23,750
Yes.

1541
01:31:24,830 --> 01:31:25,830
Send a telegram to Wu Tingfang:

1542
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,200
I recognize neither the Nanjing Provisional Government

1543
01:31:28,410 --> 01:31:30,410
nor its so-called President Sun Wen.

1544
01:31:34,700 --> 01:31:35,410
Yat-sen,

1545
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:36,700
we just heard.

1546
01:31:36,910 --> 01:31:38,200
Zhang Xun has amassed

1547
01:31:38,370 --> 01:31:40,040
his troops around Suzhou.

1548
01:31:40,450 --> 01:31:41,040
Also,

1549
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:42,580
some Qing soldiers have been sighted

1550
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:44,580
near Qinhuai River this afternoon.

1551
01:31:44,950 --> 01:31:45,450
Mr. President,

1552
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:46,080
we advise

1553
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:47,250
delaying the inauguration ceremony.

1554
01:31:48,370 --> 01:31:49,950
Yes, better to be cautious.

1555
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:53,870
Today is New Year's Day of 1912,

1556
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:56,580
everything is renewed.

1557
01:31:57,290 --> 01:31:58,750
The Provisional President of the Republic of China

1558
01:31:58,910 --> 01:32:00,250
must be sworn in today.

1559
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:02,160
Fine.

1560
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:03,830
I'll take care of all security details

1561
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,500
for the Provisional President.

1562
01:32:07,370 --> 01:32:08,120
Photo session.

1563
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:10,620
Please, look here, here.

1564
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,040
I pledge to overthrow the Qing dynasty,

1565
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:24,200
strengthen the Republic of China,

1566
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:26,250
foster better livelihoods for all.

1567
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:28,330
These I promise to the people.

1568
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:29,870
I will follow them.

1569
01:32:30,290 --> 01:32:31,290
I will serve the country with faith.

1570
01:32:31,790 --> 01:32:32,950
I will serve all people.

1571
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:35,330
Until the hegemony of the Qing dynasty is overthrown,

1572
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:36,910
and the country has no strife,

1573
01:32:37,330 --> 01:32:38,870
when China will stand tall in the World,

1574
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:40,410
recognized among nations.

1575
01:32:40,950 --> 01:32:41,750
At that time,

1576
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:44,290
I will resign from the position of Provisional President.

1577
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:48,750
This is my pledge to all citizens of China.

1578
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:04,250
Just now,

1579
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:07,200
I pledged myself as the Provisional President.

1580
01:33:07,790 --> 01:33:08,330
Now,

1581
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:09,870
I have a few words to add.

1582
01:33:10,370 --> 01:33:11,080
Today,

1583
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:13,660
the Republic of China is established,

1584
01:33:14,870 --> 01:33:17,370
but the feudal court still stands.

1585
01:33:18,370 --> 01:33:20,160
Unless feudalism is uprooted,

1586
01:33:20,830 --> 01:33:22,500
our Revolution isn't complete.

1587
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:25,540
I await

1588
01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:27,500
the day

1589
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:30,830
I'll relinquish my position

1590
01:33:31,410 --> 01:33:32,160
to the person

1591
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:34,080
who carries through the abdication of the Qing Emperor.

1592
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:43,830
What's going on?

1593
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:47,120
I'd said it before, we shouldn't rush to elect a President.

1594
01:33:47,540 --> 01:33:50,000
The Beiyang Army has been mobilized, war will erupt very soon.

1595
01:33:50,370 --> 01:33:51,580
I hear Yuan Shikai has even engaged assassins.

1596
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:52,950
Who's afraid of assassins?

1597
01:33:53,870 --> 01:33:54,660
Mr. Sun,

1598
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:55,580
may I suggest,

1599
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:57,500
in view of the situation,

1600
01:33:57,660 --> 01:33:58,790
please ponder this seriously.

1601
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,540
If Yuan Shikai doesn't depose the Qing court,

1602
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:02,040
President Sun will not step down.

1603
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:06,290
Does Mr. Sun want to indulge in the position of President?

1604
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:07,660
Wang Zhaoming,

1605
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:11,040
Sun Wen isn't that type.

1606
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:12,580
Since he's so selfless,

1607
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:13,790
what's the harm of my asking?

1608
01:34:13,950 --> 01:34:15,160
It's all about trust,

1609
01:34:15,620 --> 01:34:16,290
belief,

1610
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:17,580
and faith

1611
01:34:17,830 --> 01:34:18,580
without any doubt.

1612
01:34:18,790 --> 01:34:19,700
I'm only afraid of

1613
01:34:20,370 --> 01:34:21,620
an all-out battle between North and South.

1614
01:34:21,790 --> 01:34:23,160
Who'd be responsible for that?

1615
01:34:23,330 --> 01:34:24,870
If our Revolution is stolen by someone else,

1616
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:26,540
who'd be responsible for that?

1617
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:28,120
Huang Keqiang, you...

1618
01:34:28,290 --> 01:34:28,700
Zhaoming.

1619
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:30,200
Stop arguing, please.

1620
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:32,910
I protect you in front of everyone,

1621
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:35,830
but we must be frank behind closed doors.

1622
01:34:36,910 --> 01:34:38,370
You don't have to close any doors.

1623
01:34:39,250 --> 01:34:40,200
Just say it, Keqiang.

1624
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:44,250
We cannot accede to any of Yuan Shikai's demands.

1625
01:34:47,870 --> 01:34:49,000
But he has the power.

1626
01:34:49,200 --> 01:34:51,370
He can quickly depose the Qing court.

1627
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,660
To establish our Republic

1628
01:34:53,830 --> 01:34:55,660
we need not only battles but also politics.

1629
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:56,910
This is Revolution,

1630
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:58,290
not giving a crown to someone else.

1631
01:34:59,080 --> 01:34:59,870
Sun Wen,

1632
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:02,410
the Revolution doesn't belong to any single person.

1633
01:35:03,870 --> 01:35:04,500
Keqiang,

1634
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:06,200
what do you mean?

1635
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:07,160
You don't understand.

1636
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:08,330
Idon%?

1637
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:10,660
You're accusing me of not understanding politics.

1638
01:35:11,410 --> 01:35:12,290
But I know Yuan Sl'1il<ai.

1639
01:35:12,450 --> 01:35:13,290
Keqiang.

1640
01:35:13,450 --> 01:35:14,250
You've never seen

1641
01:35:14,410 --> 01:35:16,750
how he killed young men.

1642
01:35:17,450 --> 01:35:18,790
I'm Worried.

1643
01:35:19,830 --> 01:35:21,660
He might become an enemy of the Republic.

1644
01:35:22,410 --> 01:35:23,120
He might

1645
01:35:23,450 --> 01:35:24,700
even restore autocratic rule.

1646
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:38,040
It's my ninth wife's birthday.

1647
01:35:39,790 --> 01:35:42,410
Westerners celebrate birthdays with cakes.

1648
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:43,950
But we don't.

1649
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:46,330
We eat peaches.

1650
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:48,750
Look how festive they ere.

1651
01:35:51,450 --> 01:35:52,580
It hurts.

1652
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:54,160
Please let go.

1653
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:55,870
It hurts.

1654
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:56,790
Where's Weiting?

1655
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:58,160
I need to talk to him.

1656
01:35:58,700 --> 01:35:59,830
What happened?

1657
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:00,910
Weiting,

1658
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:02,410
let's step aside.

1659
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:04,750
What are you afraid of?

1660
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:06,450
So what if I want to revolt?

1661
01:36:06,950 --> 01:36:07,700
So what?

1662
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:10,830
It's high time

1663
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:14,040
we race against Sun Wen.

1664
01:36:14,330 --> 01:36:15,000
Look, they haven't been idle:

1665
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:17,580
Electing President,

1666
01:36:17,910 --> 01:36:19,540
setting up government.

1667
01:36:20,290 --> 01:36:21,620
The best peaches on the tree

1668
01:36:21,790 --> 01:36:24,000
are picked clean by others.

1669
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:28,000
I'll kill you.

1670
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:29,830
You're a madman.

1671
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:31,080
Stop him. Stop him.

1672
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:32,910
Sputtering madness.

1673
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:34,500
Help.

1674
01:36:34,660 --> 01:36:35,870
Please stop him.

1675
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:37,080
Stop him.

1676
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:38,750
Weiting.

1677
01:36:38,910 --> 01:36:40,000
Calm down.

1678
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:51,750
Why did you hit him so hard?

1679
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,080
At this moment,

1680
01:36:53,250 --> 01:36:55,450
I can't afford even one mistake.

1681
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:57,620
You're right.

1682
01:36:58,040 --> 01:36:58,950
It's simple.

1683
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:01,750
I'm sitting on a bed of nails.

1684
01:37:03,370 --> 01:37:04,910
If I don't force the court,

1685
01:37:05,450 --> 01:37:07,120
the situation is dire:

1686
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:09,750
The Revolutionaries control half the country,

1687
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:12,620
I can't oppose them much longer.

1688
01:37:14,330 --> 01:37:17,950
But if the Emperor abdicates because of me,

1689
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,870
I'll be blamed for generations to come.

1690
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:22,450
This is indeed

1691
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:24,160
a tricky situation.

1692
01:37:24,330 --> 01:37:25,410
The crux of the matter is,

1693
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:28,330
I want to become President.

1694
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,040
When I arrived,

1695
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:03,450
I was resentful.

1696
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:05,830
But now that I've seen you,

1697
01:38:06,950 --> 01:38:08,410
I'm no longer angry.

1698
01:38:17,870 --> 01:38:18,950
Now,

1699
01:38:20,870 --> 01:38:23,950
our baby is inside me.

1700
01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:39,950
Keqiang,

1701
01:38:40,950 --> 01:38:42,580
this painting will soon be finished.

1702
01:38:44,870 --> 01:38:46,450
But I can't decide

1703
01:38:48,410 --> 01:38:49,250
where to hang it.

1704
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:54,200
I want to propose.

1705
01:38:54,910 --> 01:38:56,750
Wu Tingfang to issue a public statement.

1706
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:58,450
If the Emperor doesn't abdicate,

1707
01:38:58,660 --> 01:38:59,910
the ceasefire will end.

1708
01:39:00,290 --> 01:39:01,330
Whoever tarries,

1709
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:02,700
whoever resists,

1710
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,500
will be punished by all.

1711
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:05,870
If the truce cannot be maintained,

1712
01:39:06,160 --> 01:39:07,330
we'll declare war again.

1713
01:39:07,950 --> 01:39:08,950
If we resume war,

1714
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:10,790
I'll lead the troops to the North.

1715
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:12,660
Keqiang.

1716
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:14,120
You were right.

1717
01:39:14,330 --> 01:39:15,500
I've thought long and hard.

1718
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:18,830
We have to establish provisional laws.

1719
01:39:20,950 --> 01:39:22,950
It's unimportant who serves a single term.

1720
01:39:23,370 --> 01:39:24,410
We must establish

1721
01:39:24,580 --> 01:39:25,910
a system

1722
01:39:28,370 --> 01:39:30,290
to restrain not only Yuan Shikai

1723
01:39:30,910 --> 01:39:31,580
but

1724
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:34,330
anyone who ever dreams of becoming an emperor.

1725
01:39:35,410 --> 01:39:35,910
Painter,

1726
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:38,040
please use bright red for the flag with 18 stars.

1727
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:38,910
Yes.

1728
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:45,290
Comradres, I hear you are

1729
01:39:45,540 --> 01:39:46,580
disputing my resignation,

1730
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:50,410
but it takes more than a day

1731
01:39:50,580 --> 01:39:52,500
of feudal hegemony.

1732
01:39:52,870 --> 01:39:54,620
I do hope you will not just focus on

1733
01:39:54,790 --> 01:39:56,040
one official title,

1734
01:39:56,250 --> 01:39:58,410
but create a truly relevant,

1735
01:39:58,580 --> 01:40:00,620
legally protected revolutionary system.

1736
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:03,000
The vvol'ldisirT1h'1ehse. Those who follow the righteous path thrive,

1737
01:40:03,290 --> 01:40:05,080
those who do not become extinct.

1738
01:40:05,370 --> 01:40:07,160
I hold fast to the Revolution,

1739
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,120
knowing it will bear fruit.

1740
01:40:09,660 --> 01:40:10,910
After such a long journey,

1741
01:40:11,290 --> 01:40:12,750
we will reach our revolutionary goal.

1742
01:40:12,910 --> 01:40:16,250
What does Sun Wen want?

1743
01:40:17,950 --> 01:40:19,080
What telegram?

1744
01:40:20,290 --> 01:40:22,620
What declaration? What war?

1745
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:31,790
Mr. Jordan is right.

1746
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:34,410
It is most important to hold onto power.

1747
01:40:39,290 --> 01:40:42,330
The President's chair isn't comfortable.

1748
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:44,910
Even if it's full of pins,

1749
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:47,790
I still Want to sit on it.

1750
01:40:48,450 --> 01:40:51,870
The British Ambassador told me:

1751
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:56,500
That winter, like today,

1752
01:40:57,290 --> 01:41:00,450
the winds were chilly,

1753
01:41:00,870 --> 01:41:02,790
it was snowing.

1754
01:41:04,580 --> 01:41:06,660
It was around Spring Festival,

1755
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:09,910
but the entire city was desolate,

1756
01:41:10,290 --> 01:41:13,040
the atmosphere almost tragic.

1757
01:41:14,330 --> 01:41:15,450
The guillotine was placed

1758
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:17,830
in the middle of the public square,

1759
01:41:18,830 --> 01:41:20,250
icicles of blood

1760
01:41:20,540 --> 01:41:23,000
still hanging on the blade.

1761
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:26,290
Louis XVI

1762
01:41:26,870 --> 01:41:28,450
was bound and taken there.

1763
01:41:29,790 --> 01:41:32,580
He was cold, without even a coat.

1764
01:41:32,750 --> 01:41:34,660
He was shivering.

1765
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:37,410
Everyone brought their family

1766
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:40,660
to witness this great occasion.

1767
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:45,160
When the hour came,

1768
01:41:45,450 --> 01:41:47,080
the executioner put the King's head on the block,

1769
01:41:47,250 --> 01:41:49,160
the blade was released,

1770
01:41:49,540 --> 01:41:51,290
there was ice on his face.

1771
01:41:51,450 --> 01:41:52,750
Listen...

1772
01:41:54,830 --> 01:41:56,040
Go on, Yuan Shikai.

1773
01:41:56,330 --> 01:41:56,910
Go on.

1774
01:41:57,080 --> 01:41:58,250
Listen.

1775
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:00,830
The whoosh of the blade.

1776
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:04,330
The whoosh of the blade. Then?

1777
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:05,870
Go on, Yuan Shikai.

1778
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:08,200
Then, the end.

1779
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:12,660
The end?

1780
01:42:12,830 --> 01:42:14,160
That quick?

1781
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,200
Yuan Shikai,

1782
01:42:16,370 --> 01:42:19,660
you're kidding.

1783
01:42:19,910 --> 01:42:21,290
You're making this up.

1784
01:42:21,620 --> 01:42:24,200
You've made up this story from the West for me.

1785
01:42:24,370 --> 01:42:26,620
I reappointed you against my better conscience,

1786
01:42:26,830 --> 01:42:28,950
yet you do this to me?

1787
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:31,660
Royal Prince, appease your anger.

1788
01:42:31,950 --> 01:42:35,200
Did the French also celebrate Spring Festival?

1789
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:37,910
Royal Prince, calm down.

1790
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:40,080
Royal Prince.

1791
01:42:47,790 --> 01:42:49,120
I've received news that.

1792
01:42:49,330 --> 01:42:51,910
Sun Wen insists on a Republic. They will not compromise.

1793
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:53,410
Empress Dowager,

1794
01:42:53,830 --> 01:42:55,750
I tell you the story of the French Revolution

1795
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:59,580
because I don't want you and the princes

1796
01:42:59,750 --> 01:43:01,120
to share the same fate.

1797
01:43:01,330 --> 01:43:03,160
I'm loyal to you.

1798
01:43:03,580 --> 01:43:05,580
Heaven can attest to it.

1799
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:10,830
Yuan Shikai,

1800
01:43:12,330 --> 01:43:13,000
come over here.

1801
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:27,910
Come over here.

1802
01:43:42,290 --> 01:43:43,250
Empress Dowager

1803
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:52,410
I'm at your command.

1804
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:55,790
What if

1805
01:43:56,450 --> 01:43:57,830
that day comes?

1806
01:43:58,910 --> 01:44:01,160
You won't let Us

1807
01:44:01,790 --> 01:44:02,870
face the guillotine,

1808
01:44:04,870 --> 01:44:07,330
you won't let us starve.

1809
01:44:07,620 --> 01:44:09,080
Certainly.

1810
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:13,830
Go back.

1811
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
The South is eager to resume battle,

1812
01:44:15,200 --> 01:44:16,750
Empress Dowager, please ponder this.

1813
01:44:20,410 --> 01:44:21,200
I know.

1814
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:27,120
I take my leave.

1815
01:44:40,330 --> 01:44:42,410
- Prince Regent. - Here.

1816
01:44:42,870 --> 01:44:44,410
Yuan Shikai has broken his promise,

1817
01:44:44,700 --> 01:44:45,790
he's banded with the rebels.

1818
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:47,160
I do regret this.

1819
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:50,290
I dismiss him as Prime Minister.

1820
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:51,950
Things have developed thus.

1821
01:44:55,370 --> 01:44:58,660
It won't help.

1822
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:16,000
They're still dragging their feet, prolonging their dynasty?

1823
01:45:16,290 --> 01:45:17,410
They are acting against people's wishes.

1824
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:18,700
How they overreach themselves.

1825
01:45:18,910 --> 01:45:20,370
They're becoming enemies of all people.

1826
01:45:20,660 --> 01:45:22,250
What a pipe dream,

1827
01:45:22,410 --> 01:45:24,750
thinking they can still hang on.

1828
01:45:26,830 --> 01:45:27,540
What happened?

1829
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:28,870
Mr. Sun.

1830
01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:34,040
What is it?

1831
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:35,700
Send a telegram,

1832
01:45:36,910 --> 01:45:38,290
make it public.

1833
01:45:40,540 --> 01:45:43,290
The Revolutionary Party's patience is running out.

1834
01:45:44,250 --> 01:45:47,040
Don't these feudalists have any shame?

1835
01:45:48,290 --> 01:45:49,500
Reporting to the Empress Dowager:

1836
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:52,160
Our Ambassador to Russia and others have sent telegrams to you,

1837
01:45:52,620 --> 01:45:56,580
hoping that you treasure the Chinese people rather than insisting on one man's position.

1838
01:45:57,410 --> 01:46:00,660
There are mutinies in the Northeast, Xinjiang and Tibet.

1839
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:04,330
43 generals, including Feng Guozhang and Duan Qirui,

1840
01:46:04,750 --> 01:46:06,160
have signed a petition in support of the Republic.

1841
01:46:06,450 --> 01:46:08,700
Tell me something I don't already know.

1842
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:13,580
Empress Dowager.

1843
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:17,120
We have served you and the royal court. We do not support the idea of a Republic.

1844
01:46:17,910 --> 01:46:19,790
Please do not falter in your position.

1845
01:46:19,950 --> 01:46:21,410
Why would I falter?

1846
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:25,580
It's all Yuan Shikai's doing.

1847
01:46:25,790 --> 01:46:27,410
Yuan had betrayed Emperor Guangxu,

1848
01:46:27,620 --> 01:46:28,790
now he betrays Emperor Xuantong.

1849
01:46:28,950 --> 01:46:30,700
He's a real traitor.

1850
01:46:30,870 --> 01:46:31,950
His family has received such grace from the court,

1851
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:33,290
yet he's such an unfilial cur.

1852
01:46:33,450 --> 01:46:34,870
He has the ambition of Wang Mang in becoming Emperor.

1853
01:46:35,040 --> 01:46:36,330
If the Emperor doesn't abdicate,

1854
01:46:36,620 --> 01:46:38,660
he can't make his deal.

1855
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:41,080
I'd told you before, he's not to be trusted.

1856
01:46:41,250 --> 01:46:42,450
As long as Aisin Gioro is here,

1857
01:46:42,620 --> 01:46:44,200
the Qing Dynasty will not fall.

1858
01:46:44,370 --> 01:46:45,950
Ancestors in Heaven,

1859
01:46:47,290 --> 01:46:48,040
HOW

1860
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:49,870
other countries bully us,

1861
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:51,660
the Revolutionaries run wild,

1862
01:46:52,950 --> 01:46:54,330
our ministers are corrupt,

1863
01:46:54,580 --> 01:46:55,950
they sell whatever they can

1864
01:46:56,330 --> 01:46:57,910
for their own gains.

1865
01:46:58,950 --> 01:47:00,370
There's nothing left now.

1866
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:02,830
We have failed you.

1867
01:47:04,910 --> 01:47:05,870
At least Sun Wen

1868
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:07,500
is Clement.

1869
01:47:07,790 --> 01:47:08,750
He doesn't invade the Palace,

1870
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:10,450
there are no guillotines.

1871
01:47:11,290 --> 01:47:13,250
We want a bloodless revolution,

1872
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:14,750
no more sacrifices...

1873
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:17,040
or needless killings.

1874
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,620
Abdicate.

1875
01:47:49,450 --> 01:47:50,410
Friends, greetings.

1876
01:47:51,620 --> 01:47:53,750
This is a historical day,

1877
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:55,250
let's begin.

1878
01:47:56,450 --> 01:47:58,000
- Mr. President, this way. - Let's

1879
01:47:58,450 --> 01:47:59,660
have a pose.

1880
01:48:00,370 --> 01:48:00,830
How?

1881
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:03,580
- Mr. President, please lift up your hat. - OK.

1882
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:05,330
Let's change a bit.

1883
01:48:05,540 --> 01:48:07,080
Mr. President, this way.

1884
01:48:07,450 --> 01:48:09,120
Mr. President, you look so young.

1885
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:11,750
Such glib words.

1886
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:15,160
When you cut my queue,

1887
01:48:15,540 --> 01:48:16,620
don't hurry,

1888
01:48:16,870 --> 01:48:18,000
take your time,

1889
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:19,580
move slowly.

1890
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:22,830
This is a historical moment, do you understand?

1891
01:48:23,290 --> 01:48:23,950
Yes.

1892
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:28,000
You talk about Revolution and Republic all the time.

1893
01:48:28,540 --> 01:48:30,660
A Revolutionary has to have a Revolutionary look.

1894
01:48:30,830 --> 01:48:33,790
Let me show you.

1895
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:34,830
Look.

1896
01:48:45,450 --> 01:48:46,750
Ambassadors,

1897
01:48:48,250 --> 01:48:51,330
Today I meet you as the Provisional President

1898
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:53,330
for the first time,

1899
01:48:58,700 --> 01:48:59,870
also the last time.

1900
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:03,910
I can't believe this.

1901
01:49:04,790 --> 01:49:06,120
Before I leave the Presidency,

1902
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:09,080
I hope you will request your respective governments

1903
01:49:09,620 --> 01:49:11,870
to recognize our new country.

1904
01:49:12,830 --> 01:49:13,830
To you

1905
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:15,120
and to the entire world,

1906
01:49:15,330 --> 01:49:16,450
this is truly significant.

1907
01:49:16,620 --> 01:49:17,500
Mr. President,

1908
01:49:17,660 --> 01:49:20,200
how do you plan to treat the Qing royal family?

1909
01:49:20,870 --> 01:49:22,790
They'll become citizens of the Republic.

1910
01:49:25,330 --> 01:49:26,620
The Revolutionary Party has decided

1911
01:49:26,790 --> 01:49:28,950
to pay the royal family 4 million taels of silver.

1912
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:30,700
Is that how you treat your citizens?

1913
01:49:30,870 --> 01:49:32,870
Money cannot be a measure here.

1914
01:49:33,790 --> 01:49:35,870
Not all revolutions need guillotines.

1915
01:49:36,410 --> 01:49:37,700
What do you say, Mr. Ambassador?

1916
01:49:38,330 --> 01:49:40,120
I agree.

1917
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:43,000
When I was in England,

1918
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:45,200
I once met one of your parliament members, Mr. Hillier.

1919
01:49:45,500 --> 01:49:46,200
I told him,

1920
01:49:46,700 --> 01:49:48,790
when China is freed,

1921
01:49:49,540 --> 01:49:50,910
I'd invite him as my guest.

1922
01:49:52,290 --> 01:49:54,200
I'll use Chinese liquor,

1923
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:55,660
Revolutionary liquor, to toast him.

1924
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:57,700
Come,

1925
01:49:58,540 --> 01:49:59,200
cheers.

1926
01:49:59,660 --> 01:50:01,290
Minbao, Xinwenbao and other newspapers

1927
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:03,910
nave published articles questioning your decision to step down.

1928
01:50:04,450 --> 01:50:05,450
I read them.

1929
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:07,040
We're in financial trouble.

1930
01:50:07,330 --> 01:50:10,040
We can't find funds for restitutions to the martyrs' families.

1931
01:50:10,450 --> 01:50:11,080
We must find some money

1932
01:50:11,540 --> 01:50:12,830
no matter how.

1933
01:50:14,750 --> 01:50:16,330
People's representatives want to meet you.

1934
01:50:16,870 --> 01:50:17,870
Please set up a time.

1935
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:19,580
Yes.

1936
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:21,000
Homer Lea is determined

1937
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:22,620
to resign from his post as Military Advisor.

1938
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:24,000
What's his reason?

1939
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:26,410
He said he won't Work with Yuan Shikai.

1940
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:30,330
Tell him,

1941
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:32,370
he's helping China,

1942
01:50:32,750 --> 01:50:33,660
not just a person.

1943
01:50:37,410 --> 01:50:39,000
This is a letter from Juemin.

1944
01:50:39,660 --> 01:50:41,410
Yat-serfs been Keeping it for you.

1945
01:50:41,950 --> 01:50:43,000
He asks that I give it to you.

1946
01:50:48,910 --> 01:50:51,910
A few days ego, members of the Tongmenghui came to see me.

1947
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,950
They are planning a new grave.

1948
01:50:56,370 --> 01:50:58,290
They asked that I prepare a funerary outfit.

1949
01:51:00,370 --> 01:51:01,790
I went to the shop.

1950
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:04,830
When he was alive,

1951
01:51:05,950 --> 01:51:07,370
Juemin and I always made decisions together.

1952
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:11,290
So I asked,

1953
01:51:13,870 --> 01:51:14,830
Juemin,

1954
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:17,790
which one do you want?

1955
01:51:29,870 --> 01:51:31,290
Only then did I know

1956
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:36,000
he's no longer with me.

1957
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,000
Zhongxin,

1958
01:51:54,290 --> 01:51:56,080
this is a letter from your father.

1959
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:02,330
Look.

1960
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:10,330
"Letter to My Wife"

1961
01:52:11,950 --> 01:52:14,330
shouldn't be kept only in this household.

1962
01:52:16,200 --> 01:52:17,660
Keep it,

1963
01:52:18,410 --> 01:52:20,370
let others know about it.

1964
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:48,950
Yesterday,

1965
01:52:49,370 --> 01:52:50,580
the Qing Emperor abdicated,

1966
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,620
ending two millennia of monarchy.

1967
01:52:54,410 --> 01:52:56,040
Countless revolutionaries have given up their lives

1968
01:52:56,250 --> 01:52:58,160
for our new Republic.

1969
01:53:00,450 --> 01:53:01,080
Today,

1970
01:53:01,330 --> 01:53:03,910
February 13, 1912,

1971
01:53:04,410 --> 01:53:06,410
26th day of the 12th moon of the Xinhai Year.

1972
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:09,000
Keep my promise,

1973
01:53:09,290 --> 01:53:11,410
I resign from the post of President.

1974
01:53:13,410 --> 01:53:14,910
We strive for the success of the Revolution,

1975
01:53:15,290 --> 01:53:16,870
but do not covet recognition.

1976
01:53:17,620 --> 01:53:19,370
We are all of the same minds

1977
01:53:19,830 --> 01:53:22,080
to realize the goal of Revolution.

1978
01:53:23,250 --> 01:53:24,120
The goal is to establish

1979
01:53:24,580 --> 01:53:26,830
an independent country for the Chinese people.

1980
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:29,700
We build a Chinese Republic where land is divided among all.

1981
01:53:30,290 --> 01:53:33,370
Nationalism, democracy, livelihood:

1982
01:53:33,950 --> 01:53:36,580
These are what we strive to attain,

1983
01:53:36,870 --> 01:53:38,250
Three Principles.

1984
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:47,620
Today you ask me,

1985
01:53:48,120 --> 01:53:49,950
what does Revolution mean?

1986
01:53:50,750 --> 01:53:53,370
Perhaps people will ask the same question a century later.

1987
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:58,040
Qiu Jin, our Tongmenghui member who was killed in Shaoxing, said,

1988
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:00,950
Revolution will provide all children

1989
01:54:01,290 --> 01:54:04,250
a peaceful and gentle world.

1990
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:09,910
Lin Juemin, one of the martyrs of Huanghuagang, wrote this to his wife:

1991
01:54:11,250 --> 01:54:15,500
Revolution seeks eternal happiness for everyone in the World.

1992
01:54:17,950 --> 01:54:19,200
I believe

1993
01:54:19,790 --> 01:54:22,200
the Revolution enables a republican system

1994
01:54:22,370 --> 01:54:24,330
to reach the people.

1995
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:27,450
People will understand we'll fight whoever

1996
01:54:27,620 --> 01:54:29,370
dares support the monarchy.

1997
01:54:29,870 --> 01:54:32,830
Revolution enables factories,

1998
01:54:33,330 --> 01:54:36,200
banks, rail roads, mines

1999
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:39,660
owned by Chinese to benefit the people.

2000
01:54:40,750 --> 01:54:43,870
Revolution enables our Chinese race to become strong,

2001
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:46,620
no longer bullied by others.

2002
01:54:46,790 --> 01:54:49,290
We will no longer be slaves.

2003
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:53,660
Revolution can take place anywhere,

2004
01:54:53,910 --> 01:54:55,200
anytime,

2005
01:54:55,370 --> 01:54:57,040
in any heart,

2006
01:54:57,540 --> 01:54:58,580
forever,

2007
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:00,250
forever,

2008
01:55:00,950 --> 01:55:02,620
no longer afraid of foreign powers,

2009
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:04,830
ridding the country of feudalism and royalty.

2010
01:55:05,200 --> 01:55:07,160
No one will be impoverished,

2011
01:55:07,450 --> 01:55:10,750
and the Chinese people can stand tall in the East.

2012
01:55:11,870 --> 01:55:14,120
This is the meaning of Revolution.
