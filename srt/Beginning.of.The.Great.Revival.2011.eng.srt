1
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,029
Gentlemen...

2
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,433
On behalf of the business community
in Kiangsu and Anhui

3
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,871
and the 9th Nanyang Revolutionary Army,

4
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,271
I nominate Ch'en Ch'i-mei as Military Governor

5
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,119
in charge of the Shanghai garrison.

6
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,158
I'm honoured by my comrades' nomination...

7
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,150
Objection!

8
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,750
I object!

9
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,075
From Hsu Hsi-lin to Ch'iu Chin,

10
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,915
members of the Restoration Society

11
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,957
have sacrificed for the cause.

12
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,440
You're not qualified for the position!

13
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,070
Mr. T'ao,

14
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,390
to draw a line with Chinese United League

15
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,590
is inappropriate.

16
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,031
This is segregation!

17
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,078
You're not up for the task!

18
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,795
T'ao Ch'eng-chang,

19
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,192
this is counter-revolutionary!

20
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,116
You have no right to label me!

21
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,270
I'm telling you,

22
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,318
even if Sun Yat-sen were here today

23
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,555
it's still unacceptable.

24
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,399
Under Emperor Shun-chih,

25
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,949
you needed a pigtail to keep your head.

26
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,795
Business was great back then.

27
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,590
Now, it's the exact opposite,

28
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,354
you'll lose your head if you wear a pigtail.

29
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,672
Recruiting for the New Army!

30
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,917
Join the New Revolutionary Army!

31
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,514
Hurry up and enrol!

32
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,268
Hurry up and enrol!

33
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,115
I repeat,

34
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,032
Join the New Army!

35
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,030
Join the revolution!

36
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,275
I'll sign up!

37
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,956
Dr. Sun's position is clear.

38
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,669
The Emperor's abdication is a prerequisite.

39
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,550
Peiyang Clique's bottom line is equally simple.

40
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,631
Yuan Shih-k'ai must become President

41
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,270
to counter the Ch'ing court
and force the Emperor to abdicate.

42
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,713
Dr. Sun made it clear,

43
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,552
end monarchy, stop the war

44
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,395
set up a republic, anything else is negotiable.

45
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,070
I ascended the throne at a young age,

46
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,798
during a time of great upheavals,

47
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,309
I understand the will of the people,

48
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,713
that honour and glory of one family

49
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,070
should not come before it.

50
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,552
I wish that people can live on in peace

51
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,596
- among all ethnic groups. - Your Majesty,

52
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,876
- Bringing everyone under one roof
- don't play with that in court.

53
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,588
- to form the Republic of China. - Why not?

54
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,115
The Emperor will step down

55
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,997
and continue to enjoy a monarch's privileges

56
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,115
Don't cry,

57
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,994
and personally experience this new era

58
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,559
because you're the Emperor.

59
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,392
which can only be great.

60
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,751
So decreed.

61
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,599
Thank you, Your Majesty.

62
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,793
Though I'm unfit to become President,

63
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,074
upon President Sun's recommendation,

64
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,317
and the support of all ethnic groups,

65
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,713
I shall do my best

66
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,430
to make the Republic of China strong.

67
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,438
We now live in a republic, no more "long live"...

68
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,151
"Joint Harmony" dates back to Chou Dynasty.

69
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,629
According to "Records of the Grand Historian"

70
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,553
during the regency under Dukes Shao and Chou

71
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,433
state affairs were discussed
until consensus was reached.

72
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,676
I see.

73
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,831
The Emperor is gone, now we can all have a say.

74
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,035
Forget it!

75
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,076
Tse-tung,

76
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,234
who do you think should be President?

77
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,835
Dr. Sun.

78
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,511
Then why did Yuan get the job?

79
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,829
Because he has guns.

80
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,196
Before Dr. Sun stepped down,

81
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,956
he pushed through the Provisional Constitution

82
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,110
which will become the foundation.

83
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,798
A new President won't change the Republic's fate.

84
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,996
Party politics is our platform.

85
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,348
We may have conceded a title,

86
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,598
but as long as we win the election,

87
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,519
we can appoint our own cabinet members.

88
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,398
I'm afraid he is too aggressive.

89
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,239
Gentlemen, the Presidency is symbolic,

90
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,511
he can be anybody, or nobody.

91
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,756
We must dismantle one party to build another.

92
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,037
Let's turn the faltering Chinese United League,

93
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,838
whose aim was to overthrow Ch'ing Dynasty,

94
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,752
into Kuomintang, a true nationalist party,

95
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,558
the foremost political party for the Republic.

96
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,275
Sir!

97
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,312
Party politics determines
the polity of the Republic,

98
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,158
you must take it seriously.

99
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,435
Here we are!

100
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,750
Conduct a democratic, non-violent election,

101
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,397
insist on fair competition,

102
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,876
unite the Party!

103
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,829
This is important, remember it well.

104
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,190
I will.

105
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,156
Thank you.

106
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,714
I won't forget!

107
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,749
- Take care! - Take care!

108
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,353
- Take care! - Goodbye!

109
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,189
Chiao-jen!

110
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,830
I fear his thinking is too aggressive...

111
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,193
Chiao-jen!

112
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,957
Chiao-jen!

113
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,918
My mother...

114
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,389
Iives on humble means.

115
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,916
- Chiao-jen! - When I die...

116
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,193
I count on you...

117
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,237
to look after her.

118
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,675
Chiao-jen!

119
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,310
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

120
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,077
Hang in there!

121
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,639
Hang in there, Chiao-jen!

122
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,750
- Hang in there. - Chiao-jen!

123
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,509
Chiao-jen!

124
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,355
Chiao-jen!

125
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,953
At dawn on the day of the Sacrificial Rites,

126
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,159
the President changes with officials in attendance

127
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,313
then lights the ceremonial pyre,
offers jade and satin,

128
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,035
offers roast meat, reads first prayer...

129
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,270
Shih-ch'ang, the entire country seems to have

130
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,634
different opinions on the polity.

131
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,437
It's either the Japanese absolute monarchy,

132
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,153
the French parliamentary system,

133
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,993
or the American presidential system.

134
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,639
Which is more suitable for us?

135
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,794
Japanese monarchy is outdated

136
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,794
for a republic like ours.

137
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,999
That's the crux of the problem,

138
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,269
if we keep changing our minds,

139
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,396
we'll be neither here nor there.

140
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,914
What are you suggesting?

141
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,755
Follow Japan, adopt constitutional monarchy.

142
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,231
Had we persisted initially with that,

143
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,830
China would have been one of the Powers

144
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,433
and won't have to be bullied by foreign aggressors.

145
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,358
What about you, Yuan-hung?

146
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,349
Your wish is my command, Your Excellency.

147
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,155
Enough of rhetoric, this is now a Republic.

148
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,995
General Ts'ai!

149
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,350
Ts'ai O!

150
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,875
What are you doing?

151
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,673
Sir, I...

152
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,676
You like that?

153
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,396
I'll send you some later.

154
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,955
Thank you.

155
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,229
What comes after the first prayer?

156
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,912
Second and third prayer,

157
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,276
then the burning of the sacrificial offerings,

158
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,071
and everybody will bow in four directions.

159
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,833
Firstly, allow Japan to inherit

160
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,992
all German interests in Shantung

161
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,716
and agree not to cede or lease Shantung to others.

162
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,988
Secondly, Japanese subjects are permitted

163
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,278
into Southern Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia

164
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,557
to engage in commercial,
industrial and mining activities.

165
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,189
The leases on Port Arthur and Dalny,

166
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,158
and management of the Antung-Mukden Railway

167
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,312
shall be extended by 99 years.

168
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,558
That's daylight robbery!

169
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,158
Prime Minister Okuma must be out of his mind!

170
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,275
Is your Prime Minister out of his mind?

171
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,798
This document...

172
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,554
how can you explain to the Western Powers?

173
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,394
This is confidential.

174
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,633
Both parties have a duty to keep it as such.

175
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,835
Sir,

176
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,353
whoever leaks the contents,

177
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,399
regardless of his esteemed position,

178
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,798
will be sanctioned by Japan.

179
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,399
Spare me this bullshit!

180
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,790
Even Ito Hirobumi dared not threaten me
when he was alive.

181
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,598
Who do you think you are?

182
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,272
Your Excellency,

183
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,556
neither the late Ito-san

184
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,636
nor the Western Powers can save your skin.

185
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,072
Only we can do that.

186
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,437
Don't you want to be Emperor of China?

187
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,873
Have you heard?

188
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,951
Yuan Shih-k'ai accepted Japan's 21 Articles.

189
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:30,836
He's a traitor!

190
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,514
We're organising a protest, hurry...

191
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,954
Let's go, Tse-tung!

192
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,872
The strength of the Western Powers

193
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,436
Iies in their ability to tolerate opposition.

194
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,268
In Chu Chih-hsin's

195
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,749
"An Introduction of German social Revolutionaries"

196
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,231
he mentioned two western philosophers,

197
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,558
by the name of Marx and Engels.

198
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,436
Tu-hsiu!

199
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,155
Excuse me!

200
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,116
What is it?

201
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,430
Look!

202
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,912
What Yuan did was treacherous!

203
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,752
It's time we go home.

204
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,392
I heard you wish to restore monarchy.

205
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,353
Is that true?

206
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:45,231
Kuo-chang, you're one of us, I'll level with you.

207
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,911
All founding emperors in history were under 50,

208
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:58,155
I'm almost 60, too old to have this ambition.

209
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,595
That's good!

210
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,994
Whoever wants to be Emperor,

211
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,992
will suffer the wrath of the nation.

212
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,389
Sir, I must hurry back to Nanking, goodbye!

213
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,753
Having set the polity, with Heaven's mandate

214
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,152
and the will of the people ascends to the throne

215
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,074
and rules.

216
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,635
By virtue of an unanimous vote,
the Representative Assembly of the Republic

217
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,872
is in favour of the President

218
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,996
in becoming the Emperor of China.

219
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,230
Long live the Emperor!

220
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,518
Long live His Majesty!

221
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,318
I'm overwhelmed by your support.

222
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,068
I hear you insist on taking cold baths,

223
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,279
and advocate saving the country with able bodies.

224
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,429
I used to.

225
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,710
Not now?

226
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,192
I'm a bit lost.

227
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,160
With a weak country and inept Peiyang government,

228
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,352
able bodies are useless.

229
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,717
Guns and cannons against bows and arrows,

230
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,031
the outcome is obvious.

231
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,593
Look what happened in Shantung.

232
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,552
You have the answer?

233
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,399
Not yet, sir.

234
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,994
Talk is cheap,

235
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,154
finding the way out

236
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,790
may take a lifetime,

237
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,594
even generations.

238
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,830
Dad!

239
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,319
This is my daughter K'ai-hui,

240
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,068
this is Mao Tse-tung.

241
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,639
You're so tall.

242
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,995
I'll go out and play.

243
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,156
The question I ask of you is

244
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,078
what do you really want?

245
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,599
Say goodbye to Feng-hsien!

246
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,157
I wish I could bring you along.

247
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,273
Why don't you?

248
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,437
You pretended to support Yuan Shih-k'ai

249
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,358
so he'll let you go to Japan for treatment.

250
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,270
You don't want to arouse suspicion by taking me.

251
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,313
I only want to know, is a courtesan

252
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,351
really that important?

253
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,791
Everyone knows

254
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,795
I'll forsake my country for my beloved.

255
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,037
Without me, who'll take care of you?

256
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,715
Promise me you'll come back alive.

257
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,188
Unfortunately,

258
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,676
I've pledged this body and soul

259
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,270
to my country, not you.

260
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,155
Listen, you belong to 400 million Chinese

261
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,591
as well as to me, Hsiao Feng-hsien.

262
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,109
I know.

263
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,317
I appeal to all of you

264
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,196
to answer to a call of duty.

265
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,555
Should Yuan refuse to come to his senses,

266
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,755
he will be punished by an army of justice.

267
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,911
An army of justice?

268
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,749
Well said!

269
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,878
But where's your army?

270
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,228
General Ts'ai is here, sir!

271
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,555
Here comes my army!

272
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,793
You look so frail!

273
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,712
- Dr. Sun, I... - Take your time...

274
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,710
Have a seat!

275
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,911
Reviving the monarchy is a regression.

276
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,229
It's fatal to China. We must launch an expedition.

277
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,310
Commander-in-chief,

278
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,671
Captain Chu Te of the 6th detachment is here.

279
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,831
Go ahead.

280
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,797
Enemy troops defending Mienhuapo

281
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,635
are led by Wu of Peiyang's 6th Brigade.

282
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,109
Take the advance guard off duty,

283
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,315
Iet them rest.

284
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,590
We'll attack tomorrow at dawn.

285
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,993
We must capture Mienhuapo within a day.

286
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,910
Yes, sir!

287
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,830
Bring up all our heavy artillery.

288
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,399
Who the hell is their commander?

289
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,269
Wu P'ei-fu!

290
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,840
Son of a bitch!

291
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,189
What's going on here?

292
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,591
Feng Kuo-chang and the generals just declared

293
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,753
their opposition to the new polity.

294
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,229
And the Military Governor Lu Jung-t'ing

295
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,239
has declared Kuanghsi independent.

296
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,753
The country is in uproar!

297
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,869
Perhaps we should postpone the accession rites.

298
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,917
It's mere formality.

299
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,674
It now depends on Chen Huan and Ts'ao K'un,

300
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,708
if they can defeat Ts'ai O in Szechuan,

301
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:11,158
we might still have a chance.

302
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,548
Ts'ai is hounding me to my grave...

303
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,876
I'd high hopes for you, but you let me down.

304
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:54,716
Mr. Fan Ching-sheng, the Minister of Education

305
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,348
will now confer the letters of appointment.

306
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,272
On behalf of the Ministry of Education

307
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,917
and the National Peking University Council,

308
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,830
I appoint Ch'en Tu-hsiu
as Dean of the School of Letters,

309
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:30,517
Chu Hsi-chu as lecturer in Literature,

310
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,318
Li Ta-chao as Head Librarian,

311
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,152
and Ku Hung-ming as English Professor.

312
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,874
Isn't he the renowned academic?

313
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,919
Why does he dress like that?

314
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,275
What's so funny?

315
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,556
I wear my pigtail at the back of my head,

316
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,389
those who laugh at me wear it in their hearts.

317
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,634
Mine is visible,

318
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,074
yours is not.

319
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:49,351
Feel free to enjoy it.

320
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,674
How dare you! This is the Senate,

321
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,513
the sacred ground of the Republic.

322
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,754
What sacred ground?

323
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,311
Just a bunch of pathetic scholars

324
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,989
who are doomed to fail.

325
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,310
What do you mean, General?

326
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,193
I'm Peiyang's Joint Chief Military Governor,

327
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,551
Chang Hsun is my name.

328
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,078
I'm here to settle the dispute with the Senate,

329
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,077
Understand? I hereby proclaim

330
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,432
effective immediately

331
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,350
this dump is closed, the party is over.

332
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,794
Understand?

333
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,911
The Senate is the Republic's legislative body,

334
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,758
you have no right to close it down.

335
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,835
Listen...

336
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,155
I'm not only shutting down

337
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,118
this cackling dump of a Senate,

338
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,796
I'm also closing down

339
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,395
your bloody Republic.

340
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,913
Long live Your Majesty!

341
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,953
You may rise.

342
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,191
Thank you, Your Majesty.

343
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,115
Your Majesty!

344
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,829
Your Majesty!

345
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:12,276
I'm late, Your Majesty!

346
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,750
You may look up when you speak.

347
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:23,352
Without Your Majesty, the country is at a loss.

348
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,836
268 years of the glorious Ch'ing Dynasty

349
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,788
must not be ended by that Sun Yat-sen.

350
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:37,036
They bullied you because you're a child.

351
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,951
They took advantage of your age.

352
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,636
Alright... I appoint you as my Cabinet Minister

353
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,634
Viceroy of Zhili, Minister of Peiyang,

354
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,159
with the title of First Lord.

355
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:09,074
Thank you, Your Majesty.

356
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,910
You may run three laps around the Palace.

357
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,032
His Majesty allows you to also fly a kite.

358
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,275
It's flying!

359
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,834
Flying...

360
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:35,795
Your Majesty,

361
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,709
Look!

362
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,712
It's airborne!

363
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:05,115
Don't be scared. This is outrageous!

364
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,953
We still have a proclamation to make...

365
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,429
Don't force him to be Emperor,

366
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,068
we only want to be safe.

367
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,155
Traitor!

368
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,432
I, Tuan Ch'i-jui, Premier of the Republic of China

369
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,110
and Commander-in-Chief of the expedition force,

370
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,676
hereby condemn Chang Hsun and his clique

371
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,638
for forcibly dissolving the Senate,
holding the President hostage

372
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,076
and restoring monarchy.
Such action is contemptible

373
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,795
and against the will of the people and Heaven.

374
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,749
I, Tuan Ch'i-jui,

375
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,599
resuming as Premier on President Li's instruction

376
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,592
will lead a punitive expedition
to crush the traitors.

377
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,917
July 2, this 6th year of the Republic.

378
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,873
It's time for us students to take action.

379
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,758
Go to Peking and rally against the restoration.

380
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,035
I don't understand.

381
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,634
About what?

382
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,953
By conceding the presidency to Yuan

383
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,314
the Senate has made a fatal error.

384
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,429
The problem with China

385
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,790
is not just about choosing the wrong President!

386
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,113
Isn't that a reason?

387
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,951
If all fault lies with the head of state,

388
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,198
then the problems we had before

389
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,311
were Yuan Shih-k'ai's fault.

390
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,080
But what about the restoration fiasco?

391
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,958
Who should we blame?

392
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,514
What are you getting at?

393
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,109
Today's China

394
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:35,116
cannot be changed by having a
different Emperor or President.

395
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,119
An utmost humiliation!

396
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,359
The Chinese race has been shamed!

397
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:54,155
Republic is a must and demanded by the people.

398
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:00,191
Yet in a mere six years,

399
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,676
we already have two emperors.

400
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:08,158
Remember, China is a republic,

401
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,837
to have an emperor in a republic

402
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,356
is so utterly ironic.

403
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,872
Bravo!

404
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,039
The Republic champions freedom,
equality and philanthropy.

405
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,398
Yet, since the founding of the Republic,

406
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,239
equality has been ignored, freedom trampled on,

407
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,755
philanthropy does not exist.

408
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,878
Lives were lost and blood was shed

409
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,998
in exchange for a republic in name only.

410
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,635
That is intolerable!

411
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,952
Is this the Republic

412
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,270
people have sacrificed for?

413
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,554
It is unacceptable legally and to the Assembly,

414
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,188
and to the 400 million Chinese subjects.

415
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,756
Down with Chang Hsun!

416
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,071
Down with P'u-yi!

417
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,596
Down with Chang Hsun!

418
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,797
Down with P'u-yi!

419
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,748
Down with Chang Hsun! Down with P'u-yi!

420
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:25,630
Despite the 1 91 1 Revolution
and the rallying cry for the Republic,

421
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:32,796
people still worship Confucius

422
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,235
without learning the essence of democratic freedom.

423
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,112
Looking back over history for the past decades,

424
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:44,078
each time there's a failed republican movement,

425
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,589
monarchism will make another comeback.

426
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,316
Just like Yuan and Chang's attempts to restore.

427
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,673
Fellow students!

428
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:00,752
Feudalism and the republic are incompatible.

429
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,193
To keep one, the other must be destroyed.

430
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:09,119
In order for this country to be strong,

431
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,159
we must first remove this ancient burden

432
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,513
from the hearts of the people.

433
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,868
You're shamelessly boastful, Mr. Ch'en.

434
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,759
You praise New Culture and bury the old

435
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:07,829
and blame all our troubles on Confucianism.

436
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,596
What did Confucius do 2,000 years ago

437
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,876
that is damaging today?

438
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,148
Mr. Ku, as an erudite scholar,

439
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,710
can't you see what Confucius advocated then

440
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,108
is not applicable to us today?

441
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,869
What Confucius taught us

442
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,713
is like arithmetics.

443
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,709
2,000 years ago, 3 x 3 = 9. It still is today.

444
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,598
It will never be 8.

445
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,593
Blaming your miscalculations

446
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:42,356
on the person who invented arithmetics is absurd.

447
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:47,196
If you call that New Culture, it's bullshit.

448
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,232
Clearly a talent despite his quibbling!

449
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,672
Culture needs reforms

450
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,877
to keep up with time.

451
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,992
Some say classical Chinese is refined

452
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:09,313
while vernacular Chinese is vulgar.

453
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,634
But imperial examination system was harmful.

454
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,389
Even the best written eight-legged essays

455
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,355
were detached from society and impractical.

456
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,555
They're useless except in examinations.

457
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,635
Our country needs talents,

458
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,271
pragmatism will make us strong.

459
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,908
I represent the Women's College of Education,

460
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,793
I think classical Chinese is more concise.

461
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,949
That's a fact!

462
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,873
Please cite an example.

463
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,558
Take the phrase "unable to do it"

464
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,792
Isn't it more concise in classical Chinese?

465
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,717
That's four words.

466
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,237
You use only three in vernacular Chinese.

467
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,556
Such as?

468
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,519
"Can't be done!"

469
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,829
Bravo!

470
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,350
Before the 1 91 1 Revolution,
we modelled after Japan.

471
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,991
But it doesn't appear to be working.

472
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,879
Japan's Meiji Restoration was inspired by the West.

473
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,393
Why don't we learn from the teacher
but choose to follow the student?

474
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,393
It's not about Japanese or Americans.

475
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,068
It's a matter of new versus old culture.

476
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,992
To strengthen the country and enlighten its people,

477
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,913
we must abolish the old and popularize the new.

478
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,995
That's how our nation can be re-born.

479
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,513
Who should we learn from?

480
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,877
Whether it's the U.S., France

481
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,031
Japan, or even Russia.

482
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,668
- Learn from whoever can help China.
- Russia?

483
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,912
That's absurd!

484
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,389
The governance of any country in the world

485
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,389
is a way of thinking that stems
from its own culture.

486
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,755
Look at the world,

487
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,953
taking a macro view of the future of humanity,

488
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,314
is not absurd at all.

489
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:05,075
There's a man in Russia called Lenin,

490
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:09,037
who succeeded with the Bolshevik revolution.

491
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,239
The ideology he introduced

492
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,630
is Marxism from Germany.

493
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,639
What is Bolshevik?

494
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,760
Bolshevik means majority.

495
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:23,672
What is majority? Peasants and workers.

496
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,389
The many millions of oppressed labourers.

497
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,068
The success of Russia

498
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,311
is a victory for Bolshevism,

499
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:35,398
common people and the proletariat,

500
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,068
for the first time ever in the history of mankind,

501
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,795
and also the greatest.

502
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,273
Bravo!

503
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,390
Bravo!

504
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,953
Peiyang is up for grabs after Yuan's death.

505
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,071
Tuan Ch'i-jui used Chang Hsun
to get rid of Li Yuan-hung,

506
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,275
then he took out Chang Hsun.

507
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,351
Now he's using Wu P'ei-fu against Dr. Sun.

508
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:30,834
There's no end to this war.

509
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:33,634
If this continues, Hu'nan will be in ruins.

510
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,314
What about the Constitutional Protection Movement?

511
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,839
To succeed, Dr. Sun must launch
a northern expedition,

512
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,956
and Hu'nan will bear the brunt.

513
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,236
KMT should be stronger than the Peiyang Clique.

514
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:43,430
By some distance.

515
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,278
But in-fighting among various factions

516
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,590
makes KMT vulnerable.

517
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,239
What's your view?

518
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,994
Declare Hu'nan autonomous.

519
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:59,830
Sir...

520
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:04,036
Sir...

521
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,517
He's in a bad mood, I'm so sorry.

522
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:11,878
First the south, then the north.

523
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:16,195
Now it's north against south! There's no end to it!

524
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,557
There's no end to this revolution

525
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,719
You-jen, what are we missing?

526
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,633
Madam, same as before,

527
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,198
no money, no guns, no troops.

528
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:34,956
Fellow students,

529
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,839
I believe France is the hub
of European civilisation,

530
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,719
the standard-bearer of modern revolution,
and a model for global revolution.

531
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,790
Then let's go to France.

532
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:42,836
But...

533
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,509
to go abroad

534
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,195
we need money.

535
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,873
We'll raise it.

536
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,350
Let's split up,

537
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,551
Peking, Shanghai and Canton.

538
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:56,876
Tse-tung, where do you want to go?

539
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,190
Peking.

540
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,915
Peking?

541
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:06,510
I can visit Mr. Yang at Peking University.

542
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,274
Which faculty are you from?

543
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,831
My name is Mao Tse-tung, sir, graduate of

544
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,558
First Provincial Normal School of Hu'nan.

545
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,392
I'm visiting, came across your class,

546
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,874
and took the liberty of sitting in.

547
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,837
Mr. Mao, not that I won't let you,

548
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,991
but Peking University has its rules.

549
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,190
I'm a great admirer of yours,

550
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,191
I only wish to sit in for one session.

551
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,839
I'll leave quietly afterwards.

552
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,030
Take a seat.

553
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:15,550
Thank you.

554
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,637
The university is not a sanctuary,

555
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,956
anyone not properly dressed won't be admitted.

556
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,792
That's the rule here!

557
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,596
In any case,

558
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,228
because of Hu Shih's huge reputation

559
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,311
I don't want to miss his lecture.

560
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,437
What brings you to Peking?

561
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:40,792
To raise money for my alumni to go to France.

562
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,515
Ta-chao.

563
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,832
This student of mine...

564
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,314
what should we do with him?

565
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:49,830
You're...

566
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,595
Mr. Li Ta-chao?

567
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,312
I need an assistant.

568
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,632
Are you willing to work hard?

569
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:01,835
Absolutely!

570
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,070
I'll do anything anytime.

571
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,509
8 silver dollars a month.

572
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,635
That's plenty.

573
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,672
More than I make as a soldier.

574
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:09,909
You're a soldier?

575
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,669
Yes, but never went to war.

576
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,877
Close the door, thank you.

577
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:49,875
You are...

578
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,559
It's me!

579
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:58,716
K'ai-hui!

580
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,675
Today, we leave for the Paris Peace Conference.

581
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:26,276
For the first time in 1 00 years,

582
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,591
China shows up on international stage as a victor.

583
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,236
We won't let our nation down!

584
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,834
Let's brace ourselves

585
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,668
and demand for the return of Shantung.

586
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,990
Unite...

587
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,197
and China shall prevail!

588
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,238
Justice shall prevail!

589
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,113
Look! Behind us

590
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,793
are 400 million Chinese.

591
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,438
But a weak nation lacks diplomatic clout.

592
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,035
We shall join you in Paris later.

593
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,631
My words carry little weight,

594
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,394
but I'll do my best for the Republic.

595
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,117
Unite...

596
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,033
Justice shall prevail!

597
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,154
Sir, I once thought

598
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:21,158
our nation can be saved by strong mind and body,

599
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,589
or even by Kropotkin's anarchism.

600
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,799
But these solutions now seem superficial.

601
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,596
I read your review on Marxism

602
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,439
I think that is the truth.

603
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:36,071
My article is a mere glimpse of Marxism.

604
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,510
It's a fraction of what it is about.

605
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,996
You should study "The Communist Manifesto"

606
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,078
and its theory of a proletariat revolution.

607
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,759
That's the truth.

608
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,159
"The Communist Manifesto"

609
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:58,193
I forgot today is New Year's eve.

610
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,237
Stay for dinner.

611
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:01,996
Sir!

612
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,035
I still have work to do.

613
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,994
It's dad's prescribed hours!

614
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:34,354
We can now eat New Year dinner.

615
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,356
Great!

616
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,156
Wipe your hands!

617
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,353
Victory of the common people?

618
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,873
Didn't Uncle Li write this?

619
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:55,954
Yes, it's about the Russian revolution.

620
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,919
How is it different?

621
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,633
Most revolutions are led by the elite.

622
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,758
But in Mr. Li's thesis,

623
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:07,718
Russian revolution is a victory
of the common people.

624
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,508
Common people?

625
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,073
Let's have a drink.

626
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,233
I don't drink.

627
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,592
Just one, for the New Year.

628
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,036
Alright.

629
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,633
Let's go watch the fireworks.

630
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,878
Hurry up!

631
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:41,870
Coming...

632
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,190
Shantung is the cradle of Chinese civilisation,

633
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,510
great thinkers like Confucius and Mencius

634
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,671
were born in Shantung.

635
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,512
China cannot lose Shantung,

636
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:52,433
Iike the West can't be without Jerusalem.

637
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,391
Concerning the problem of Shantung,

638
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:09,111
the governments have already
signed a treaty of 21 Articles.

639
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:16,436
So it is not necessary to discuss
it in this conference.

640
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,995
At the Paris Peace Conference,

641
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,031
Japan proposed that German concessions in Shantung

642
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,713
should be transferred to them permanently.

643
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:24,756
As expected.

644
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:25,716
Hu Shih and I

645
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:27,632
intend to write to President Wilson,

646
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,153
and force him to mediate.

647
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,639
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

648
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,718
That's Yang's student, Mao Tse-tung.

649
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:39,999
Tse-tung, please come down.

650
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,196
Japan's ambition in China

651
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,954
is clearly a threat to American interests.

652
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,917
Wilson must do something.

653
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,076
Mr. Ch'en,

654
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,439
if Japan refuses to withdraw its troops,

655
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,079
will the U.S. send its fleet

656
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,515
to Kiautschou Bay for us?

657
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,999
So Wilson's Fourteen-Points

658
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,070
is bullshit?

659
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:01,437
He's right. Between Japan and China,

660
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,870
the Powers can only choose to support one.

661
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:07,077
They have never backed us in the past.

662
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,919
They supported Japan

663
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,350
because they wanted her to contain Russia.

664
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:14,313
They need to contain Russia now more than ever,

665
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:15,715
don't they?

666
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,193
Thank you, comrades!

667
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:34,070
Sending you to Peking

668
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,276
is to raise money,

669
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:40,315
but you spent your time reading in the library.

670
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,510
He's a genuine bookworm.

671
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,190
We can't go to France without money.

672
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,715
Going back to Hu'nan empty handed

673
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:51,154
is so humiliating.

674
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,514
A cashier's cheque

675
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,749
for 20,000 silver dollars!

676
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:03,950
Where did you get this?

677
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,155
Chang Shih-chao raised it at Mr. Yang's request.

678
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:09,989
Mao Tse-tung...

679
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,354
You left me speechless!

680
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:12,959
Do I have to pay it back?

681
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:14,396
Of course!

682
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:16,835
I'm going back to Hu'nan tonight

683
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,319
to make plans for France.

684
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:22,310
I need to stay on for a while.

685
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,549
You're not going?

686
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,911
Are you courting each other?

687
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,552
I have to go now!

688
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,149
Money!

689
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,748
Do you have to go?

690
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:46,589
I made a promise.

691
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,993
Will you come back?

692
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:57,759
Of course, the reason why I'm going

693
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:00,912
is to bring back more advanced learnings.

694
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:07,118
Mr. Yang is here,

695
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:09,713
Mr. Li, too,

696
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,275
and...

697
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:20,954
you.

698
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:32,153
Before I leave, I want to visit my parents.

699
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:36,912
If you don't come back,

700
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,151
I'll look for you in France.

701
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,669
Bad news from Paris!

702
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,511
We just got word,

703
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,950
the person who signed the loan agreement

704
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,348
with Japan last September

705
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,357
was Chang Tsung-hsiang, our envoy to Japan.

706
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:30,829
Chang Tsung-hsiang!

707
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,194
Traitor!

708
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,432
Something tumultuous is about to happen.

709
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,954
Because of the Peace Conference?

710
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,075
Yes!

711
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,953
If we succeed, the nation will rejoice.

712
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:45,435
If we fail...

713
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:47,995
Nationalism suppressed for centuries

714
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,832
will erupt like a volcano.

715
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,309
What should we do?

716
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,316
Just go with the flow.

717
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,196
We'll turn this world upside down.

718
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:08,275
Extra! Diplomatic failure in Paris!

719
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:12,228
Extra! Paris peace talk collapses...

720
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:13,630
Today,

721
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,752
Japan's conspiracy to take over Shantung

722
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,148
is about to succeed

723
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,796
due to our diplomatic failure.

724
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:24,190
If Shantung were taken by Japan,

725
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,319
our territorial integrity will be compromised,

726
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,791
and the nation will perish.

727
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,917
What should we do now?

728
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,910
Stage protests at foreign legation.

729
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,514
Calm down!

730
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,314
Don't lose sight of our objective!

731
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,033
We just want to be patriotic.

732
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,555
We're doing this to pressure
the Peiyang government.

733
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,153
Reclaim our sovereignty in Shandong.

734
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:55,991
All along,

735
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,799
we deluded ourselves into thinking

736
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:02,279
when the war is over

737
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,080
the Western Powers will help us.

738
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,029
Now we know

739
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,359
we have been betrayed

740
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,915
by the rhetoric of politicians at Versailles,

741
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,350
by the Western Powers

742
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:16,597
who are too busy carving up Europe to care.

743
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,114
And our government

744
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,030
had wanted to sign this humiliating treaty.

745
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:30,557
A historic moment is upon us.

746
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,718
Fellow students, take to the streets!

747
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:56,749
Return Tsingtao!

748
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:00,037
Defend our sovereignty!

749
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,236
Return Tsingtao!

750
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:03,674
Defend our sovereignty!

751
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,354
Return Tsingtao!

752
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,068
This is Wilson's so-called truth and justice!

753
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:12,516
The Western Powers betrayed us in Paris.

754
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,319
They betrayed China!

755
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,351
Betrayed 400 million Chinese!

756
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,312
Betrayed truth and justice!

757
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,031
Something so painfully obvious

758
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,550
but overlooked by the Peiyang government!

759
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,032
This Peiyang government

760
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,714
that can tolerate such humiliation

761
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,430
is not fit to govern us!

762
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,069
They are Western Powers' accomplices,

763
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,078
running dogs of the Japanese pirates!

764
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:40,279
In time of crisis, stand up and be counted!

765
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:44,191
Today, we want an eye for an eye,

766
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:47,992
a tooth for a tooth!

767
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:51,876
President Wilson is a scoundrel!

768
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:53,753
He deceived us!

769
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,439
He insulted us!

770
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,071
He toyed with us!

771
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,153
What should we do now?

772
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:03,516
Fellow countrymen,

773
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,435
Today, we shall petition President Hsu

774
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,309
and also the Premier.

775
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,758
We want people to know about the Paris conspiracy.

776
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:16,520
We want them to know our demands.

777
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:17,795
Whoever it is

778
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:20,838
who tries to wipe us out

779
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,913
will face a bloody battle!

780
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,394
Pay with blood!

781
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,034
Fight to the end!

782
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,997
Return Tsingtao!

783
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,434
Today's rally

784
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:35,428
is a harbinger of China's bright future.

785
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:39,554
So, this very moment, this very day...

786
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:43,633
I'm proud and honoured to be a part of

787
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:47,429
this unprecedented revolution.

788
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,873
Return our sovereignty!

789
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:58,230
Punish the traitors!

790
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:11,949
Students have taken to the streets,

791
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:13,399
they're heading for the Legation Quarter.

792
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,916
Ignorant, naive and stupid!

793
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,277
Send police to stop them!

794
01:12:19,720 --> 01:12:20,357
Yes, sir!

795
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:23,074
Fight to the end!

796
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,435
Patriotism is not a crime!

797
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,949
Fight to the end!

798
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:30,270
Patriotism is not a crime!

799
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,795
Fight to the end!

800
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,275
Fellow students!

801
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:38,229
T'an Ssu-t'ung said
"successful reforms come with bloodshed",

802
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:42,559
So let bloodshed and sacrifice begin with us!

803
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:48,750
Charge!

804
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:58,955
Come out!

805
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:03,355
Young lady!

806
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,791
Take your grievances to the prosecutors!

807
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,356
You've come to the wrong place!

808
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:14,076
My grievances are beyond the prosecutors!

809
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:15,794
What do you mean?

810
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:22,671
I'm pleading for 400 million Chinese.

811
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:29,712
Come out!

812
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:31,313
Return Tsingtao!

813
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,159
Hand over the traitors!

814
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,834
Return Tsingtao!

815
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:39,679
Hand over the traitors!

816
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:41,398
Return Tsingtao!

817
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,637
Hand over the traitors!

818
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,117
Charge!

819
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:50,153
Charge!

820
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,319
Go inside and grab the traitors!

821
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:02,034
Open up...

822
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,430
Open the door!

823
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,712
We were under siege in Japan,

824
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,355
it's happening here as well!

825
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,959
Don't cry!

826
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,874
Look, Ping-hsiang!

827
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,869
Don't worry, I'm here.

828
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,350
3 Bamboos!

829
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,512
K'uang Hu-sheng, bravo!

830
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:09,719
Jump!

831
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:10,869
Jump inside!

832
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:20,395
Soldiers!

833
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,639
Teng Chung-hsia, Fang Ho!

834
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:26,719
Go, Fang Ho!

835
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,432
1...2...3...

836
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:34,150
1...2...3...

837
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:39,755
Quiet...

838
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,559
You should be fighting Japanese in Shantung

839
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:45,951
instead of guarding a traitor's house.

840
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,989
Comrades! Brothers...

841
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:51,509
We're one family!

842
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:54,271
I believe we're one family,

843
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:58,271
Those you're holding off

844
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:01,313
are your brothers and sisters.

845
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,632
Each and every one a patriotic student.

846
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:07,837
Move aside, let us through!

847
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,675
Protect our territory!

848
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:14,434
Protect our sovereignty!

849
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:16,556
Brothers!

850
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,757
Everyone of you is patriotic

851
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:20,671
Am I right?

852
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:21,670
Yes!

853
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,552
Are you Chinese?

854
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:25,516
Yes!

855
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,517
Then let us through!

856
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:30,319
Charge!

857
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:32,670
Students!

858
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:33,716
Tell me where he is!

859
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,269
Hand over the traitor!

860
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:38,510
Search the house! Step aside...

861
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:41,399
Students...

862
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,791
Listen, harbouring traitors

863
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,837
makes you also a traitor of China.

864
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:47,670
He's here!

865
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,036
Students!

866
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:53,948
I have nothing to do with it!

867
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,076
Where is Chang Tsung-hsiang?

868
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,116
I don't know!

869
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:57,110
Take him away!

870
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:01,636
Listen...

871
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,711
This is the desk on which the treaty was signed!

872
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:12,510
Burn it...

873
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:13,874
The police are here!

874
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,273
Are you Ts'ao Ju-lin?

875
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:32,759
No, I am not...

876
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,353
- No? Then who are you? - I'm really nobody,

877
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,790
just a visiting guest.

878
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,318
Where did they go?

879
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,157
They left.

880
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,629
How could you! That's Chang Tsung-hsiang!

881
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:45,596
After him...

882
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:20,515
Let me go!

883
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,795
Let me go!

884
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:28,714
Let me go!

885
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:02,355
Consider China's 2,000-year-old history,

886
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,119
have you ever heard of

887
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:06,875
students involved in arson and killing?

888
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,435
They have no choice but to revolt.

889
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:11,355
Today...

890
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:15,349
President Hsu has arrested innocent students.

891
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:18,916
He did it to please our enemies.

892
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,271
As a staff member of the school,

893
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,510
I declare the school will go on strike

894
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,273
until the students are released.

895
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:29,352
Long live students...

896
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,796
Long live revolution...

897
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:55,709
What is it?

898
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:00,513
You wrote "The spirit of the Chinese People"

899
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,352
and I admired you for it.

900
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,509
Speaking of principles,

901
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:08,398
you should know our differences with foreigners.

902
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:10,989
But today,

903
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,197
you wrote in a Japanese-owned newspaper

904
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:16,551
denouncing the students as barbaric mobsters!

905
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:20,076
What has happened to your principles?

906
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,238
You're siding with the enemy.

907
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:48,513
Students, workers and merchants are all on strike.

908
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:52,833
Overnight, the whole country is in uproar.

909
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,954
Even soldiers are siding with the students.

910
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:00,396
This is a crucial moment, no compromise!

911
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,956
We mustn't go against the tide.

912
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,951
Tu-hsiu, what is it?

913
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:07,953
Have we won already?

914
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,232
Is this time for celebration?

915
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,149
Ridiculous!

916
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:47,509
Mr. Hu,

917
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:52,079
are you denouncing Ch'en Tu-hsiu and Li Ta-chao?

918
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,793
Why not?

919
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,039
You must have a sound argument.

920
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:05,793
Marx's doctrine is just a theory.

921
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:07,554
But such a theory

922
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:10,791
though proven successful in Russia

923
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:14,237
does not mean it's applicable in China.

924
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:18,073
We must not act like a parrot

925
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:20,879
and lose ourselves by following others.

926
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,632
To sit back and talk about theories

927
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:25,515
without solving the actual problems

928
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:28,352
is no different from Confucianism.

929
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:31,438
If this is what New Culture is about,

930
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,398
then it's meaningless.

931
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:37,834
For Ch'en and Li to model on Russia,

932
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:42,399
it's not going to solve our problems.

933
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,275
You're wrong, sir.

934
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:46,915
Confucianism is a feudal code,

935
01:23:47,200 --> 01:23:49,077
Whereas Marx's doctrine is scientific.

936
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:50,958
You can't compare the two.

937
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,193
Esteemed delegates,

938
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:19,912
what right do you have to give Shantung to Japan?

939
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,033
I am furious.

940
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:30,833
Chinese people will never forget this painful day.

941
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,233
You wouldn't dare to kill Ch'en Tu-hsiu!

942
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:43,229
If he dies, there'll be hundreds more like him.

943
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:46,318
Tell Hsu not to make himself a public enemy.

944
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,590
If he still wants to continue as President,

945
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:50,113
he must release Ch'en Tu-hsiu at once.

946
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:17,238
You have suffered, Tu-hsiu.

947
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:28,035
Ch'en Tu-hsiu takes on the burden alone,

948
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,631
and sets an example for us all.

949
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:36,028
Peking University is proud of him.

950
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:40,590
Bravo, Mr. Ch'en!

951
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,394
So sorry...

952
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,431
- Over here! - What took you so long?

953
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:07,959
We got lost!

954
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:11,113
- Hello! - We'll do the introductions later,

955
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:12,156
Iet's get on board.

956
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,548
Come on...

957
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:14,637
Let's go!

958
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:15,909
Wait...

959
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:18,516
I'm thinking...

960
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:20,797
transplanting the experience of
a foreign revolution

961
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:22,594
does it really work?

962
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:23,710
Changed your mind again?

963
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:26,075
China has much more complex issues,

964
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,074
I'd better stay.

965
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,151
Good luck all... Till we meet again.

966
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:38,755
Give me some money!

967
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:49,190
Who is he?

968
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:53,074
Mao Tse-tung from Hu'nan.

969
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:55,348
What a shame he's not going!

970
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:08,433
Why did the Governor shut down the
"Shian Kian Review"?

971
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:10,559
Because we told the truth.

972
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:14,750
He's afraid the truth will come out

973
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,795
about Chang Ching-yao being Hu'nan's public enemy.

974
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:22,035
Workers, peasants and merchants have all suffered.

975
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:25,437
Fellow workers, Hu'nan will not tolerate Chang!

976
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:28,518
Hu'nan is finished with him around.

977
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:32,638
We're only poor workers

978
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,313
we have no say.

979
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,199
How do you write the word "work"?

980
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,917
A vertical stroke between 2 lines.

981
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:43,076
Yes, heaven above your head
with your feet on the ground.

982
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,558
The words "work" and "man" together

983
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,837
make the word "heaven".

984
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:50,994
It means the world under heaven.

985
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:54,911
Workers and peasants will rule the world.

986
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:58,597
Sounds too good to be true.

987
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:01,553
This is not my idea,

988
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,957
it belongs to a foreigner called Marx.

989
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,033
This foreigner advocated

990
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:09,995
equality of all men.

991
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:12,079
Adopting this theory,

992
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:15,556
the Russian workers now rule their own country.

993
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:21,318
Fellow workers, the revolution Marx spoke
of will be universal.

994
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:26,151
Chinese workers should follow suit.

995
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:30,998
Overthrow this corrupt and evil government

996
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:35,279
that bullied and oppressed us.

997
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:40,509
Yes...

998
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:51,068
Tse-tung, your telegram.

999
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:00,918
Tse-tung...

1000
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:07,716
the doctor said dad had a stroke,

1001
01:29:08,160 --> 01:29:10,993
he can't talk, he can't hear.

1002
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:21,635
His health has deteriorated so much in a year...

1003
01:29:23,040 --> 01:29:27,192
Before taken ill,
dad hadn't stopped speaking of you.

1004
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:33,795
Remember...

1005
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:36,393
the summer of 1 91 5

1006
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:38,432
you asked me a question?

1007
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,429
All these years,

1008
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:44,438
I've been thinking hard.

1009
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:47,758
I'm close to having an answer.

1010
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:52,959
But...

1011
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:02,436
Sir...

1012
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:03,550
Dad...

1013
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:28,559
As my wife,

1014
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,114
Iife will be tough.

1015
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:36,909
If you're with me,

1016
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:40,236
you won't enjoy a stable life,

1017
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:45,353
no bridal gowns, sedan chair or banquet.

1018
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:54,351
Not even a witness or marriage license.

1019
01:31:16,240 --> 01:31:17,798
I'm willing.

1020
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:30,230
The Governor wishes to meet your representatives.

1021
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:31,589
Follow me!

1022
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:44,517
Let them go!

1023
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:46,796
You have no right to arrest us!

1024
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,598
What are you doing? Let go!

1025
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:49,796
What do you want?

1026
01:31:49,960 --> 01:31:53,794
Let go of me!

1027
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,795
Let us out!

1028
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,074
In this world,

1029
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,556
who are the noblest people?

1030
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:16,068
My answer to that...

1031
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:20,157
is the working class.

1032
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:26,638
Food, clothes, and even houses that we live in

1033
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:29,792
are all created by workers.

1034
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:32,237
We slave for a living,

1035
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:35,957
but we're not well fed, clothed or sheltered.

1036
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:37,873
Is that fair?

1037
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:39,109
No!

1038
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:41,675
Of course not!

1039
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:44,953
That's why we must unite

1040
01:32:45,160 --> 01:32:46,388
and go on strike.

1041
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:49,071
Confront these bourgeois factory owners

1042
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:50,753
and show them our strength.

1043
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:52,876
Reclaim what is rightfully ours.

1044
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:55,589
Fellow workers,

1045
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:59,437
in the future

1046
01:32:59,720 --> 01:33:01,995
workers will rule the world.

1047
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:10,435
Long live workers!

1048
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:15,231
Release the students!

1049
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,433
Sir, these students haven't eaten in 3 days.

1050
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,075
Who's not eating?

1051
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:22,269
Let him starve to death!

1052
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:24,956
He has no one but himself to blame.

1053
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,398
Who wrote this?

1054
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,074
I did.

1055
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:50,239
These are our latest demands.

1056
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:57,230
The hunger strike continues until they are met.

1057
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:05,633
We want books and newspapers.

1058
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:07,359
- Go ahead. - Yes!

1059
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:09,909
We want New Year dinner.

1060
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:14,631
I'll treat all 26 of you to dinner!

1061
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:16,349
We'll even eat outside.

1062
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,198
The Awakening Society needs a place to study.

1063
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:20,275
Certainly.

1064
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:23,195
What's your name?

1065
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,389
Chou En-lai.

1066
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:39,029
Why did you change your mind?

1067
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,032
Didn't we agree to go on hunger strike?

1068
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:44,556
Change of tactics.
Let's prepare for a long struggle!

1069
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:45,915
Let's eat.

1070
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:24,509
Goodbye!

1071
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:26,910
Mr. Ch'en!

1072
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:32,794
"Cops are after you, follow the student, Li Ta-chao"

1073
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:34,235
Follow me!

1074
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:44,800
If you leave Peking while on bail

1075
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:47,191
and get arrested again,

1076
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:48,349
it'll be difficult to get out.

1077
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:50,039
I'll go back to Shanghai.

1078
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:56,551
Scholars-in-arms are hopeless.

1079
01:35:58,080 --> 01:35:59,354
Don't say that!

1080
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:03,353
Your arrest has shaken the nation.

1081
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,796
That's as big an honour as you can get!

1082
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:11,998
What are you studying these days?

1083
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:14,995
The Russian Revolution.

1084
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:22,671
Hu Shih was right about you!

1085
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:27,036
The Russian Revolution is all you care about.

1086
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:32,392
It's the last resort when all else have failed.

1087
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:35,675
Now tell me,

1088
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:40,393
why model after Russia?

1089
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:43,280
The reason why the Russians succeeded

1090
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,830
was because the Bolsheviks

1091
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,037
united the workers and peasants,

1092
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:51,430
the broadest social classes.

1093
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:55,871
To unite the nation, you must first

1094
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,192
unite peasants and workers.

1095
01:36:58,640 --> 01:36:59,755
To unite them,

1096
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:03,273
China must first have its own Bolshevik.

1097
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:07,949
Tu-hsiu, when you get to Shanghai,

1098
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:09,678
that's exactly what you've to do.

1099
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:13,196
We'll split up, you take the north, I go south,

1100
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:15,032
form our own political party at once.

1101
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:25,395
Easy...

1102
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:28,315
When I get to Shanghai,

1103
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,596
I'll send you your favourite candy.

1104
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:32,273
You must keep your word!

1105
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:37,070
Take care!

1106
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:39,069
Take care!

1107
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:20,678
We should help China

1108
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:23,673
build her own Bolshevik Party.

1109
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:27,230
The committee nominates Maring to assist.

1110
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,673
Excellent, go right away!

1111
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:33,998
Bravo!

1112
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:42,559
What does the Shanghai dispatch say?

1113
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,676
Each region should send two delegates
to the congress,

1114
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:48,637
and the caucuses in Japan and Europe

1115
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:50,153
will each send one delegate.

1116
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:51,309
Peking, Shanghai, Canton,

1117
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:53,710
Ch'ang-sha, Wuhan and Tsinan
will all be represented.

1118
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:56,156
You and Ch'en Kung-po will represent Canton.

1119
01:38:57,160 --> 01:39:00,152
You two will represent Peking.

1120
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:01,796
Remember,

1121
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:04,269
you're there as my personal representative.

1122
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:05,635
Aren't you attending?

1123
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:08,356
The Comintern is attaching great importance to it.

1124
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:11,353
If neither you nor Mr. Ch'en attend,

1125
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:13,039
what's the point of having the congress?

1126
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:16,392
Apologise to Comrade Maring for me.

1127
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:22,035
Students are borrowing more books
for summer vacation.

1128
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:23,873
I can't leave as Head Librarian.

1129
01:39:24,240 --> 01:39:27,038
I disagree with the Comintern on many issues,

1130
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,830
if we argue during the congress

1131
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:31,832
there will be no way back.

1132
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:32,591
I see.

1133
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:33,670
Remember,

1134
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:37,871
Ch'en Tu-hsiu and I must act in unanimity.

1135
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:39,036
I understand.

1136
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:58,909
This should be enough for a month,

1137
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:03,513
when you get to Shanghai, spend when you have to.

1138
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:08,079
Dad left this,

1139
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:11,875
you have it.

1140
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:15,555
No, you keep it.

1141
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:19,394
Don't be late for the congress.

1142
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:21,830
No!

1143
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,995
Just take it.

1144
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:46,315
I'm leaving,

1145
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:51,199
take good care of yourself.

1146
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:23,432
Let me introduce myself,

1147
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:25,512
Chang Kuo-t'ao from Peking.

1148
01:41:26,640 --> 01:41:28,517
Liu Jen-ching, also from Peking.

1149
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:31,114
I'm Li Han-chun from Shanghai.

1150
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:32,993
Li Ta from Shanghai.

1151
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:34,991
Teng En-ming from Tsinan.

1152
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:37,192
Wang Chin-mei from Tsinan.

1153
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:39,154
Tung Pi-wu from Wuhan.

1154
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:41,313
Ch'en Tan-ch'iu from Wuhan.

1155
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:43,912
Chou Fo-hai from Japan.

1156
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:48,710
Pao Hui-seng, representing Ch'en Tu-hsiu.
Nice to meet you.

1157
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:50,831
Ho Shu-heng from Chang-sha.

1158
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:54,357
- This comrade from Chang-sha is...
- Tse-tung,

1159
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:56,030
it's been a while.

1160
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:57,315
Indeed, Kuo-t'ao.

1161
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:00,199
My apologies, gentlemen...

1162
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:02,191
Sorry for being late.

1163
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:04,796
Hello, everyone.

1164
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:07,835
I'm Ch'en Kung-po from Canton.

1165
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:11,272
Who's the lovely lady?

1166
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:12,077
My wife.

1167
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:14,071
Greetings, I'm Li Li-chuang.

1168
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:16,549
But we can't accommodate a couple...

1169
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:17,158
I'm sorry...

1170
01:42:17,320 --> 01:42:19,356
We've a room at Tatung Hotel across the street.

1171
01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:20,709
Bringing your spouse to the congress?

1172
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:23,030
Everyone...

1173
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:24,872
This is my wife, Wang Hui-wu.

1174
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:27,351
I'm working the reception.

1175
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:29,039
Look for me if you need anything.

1176
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:32,599
We've all had long trips, get some rest.

1177
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,233
Meet at my brother's place tomorrow.

1178
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:36,994
1 06 rue Wantz.

1179
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:38,955
I'm most honoured

1180
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:41,833
to represent Ch'en Tu-hsiu and Li Ta-chao

1181
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,798
to chair the First National Congress.

1182
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:45,915
Let me introduce to you

1183
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:47,795
Comrade Maring,

1184
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:50,354
an observer from Comintern.

1185
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:52,751
Mao Tse-tung will be our secretary.

1186
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:58,078
The first item on the agenda

1187
01:42:58,520 --> 01:42:59,669
is to decide on the name of the party.

1188
01:43:00,240 --> 01:43:04,358
Our view regarding the name of the party
is clear-cut.

1189
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:07,070
From the "The Communist Manifesto",

1190
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:08,992
we adopt the word "Communist"

1191
01:43:09,360 --> 01:43:11,510
and call it the Chinese Communist Party.

1192
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:15,390
In his letter to Tse-tung,
Ts'ai Ho-san is also in favour.

1193
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:25,673
Maring wants to know Li Ta-chao's view.

1194
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:33,272
Mr. Li's preference is

1195
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:35,229
Chinese Communist Party.

1196
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:36,116
I agree.

1197
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:37,714
Agreed.

1198
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:44,195
Agreed.

1199
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:47,189
Unanimously passed.

1200
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:05,271
Rickshaw-man,

1201
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:08,271
Tung Fang Hotel on Nanking Road.

1202
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:10,670
Let's go to Palace Hotel instead.

1203
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:12,677
We're switching hotels?

1204
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,034
We're being followed.

1205
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:16,032
Be careful, don't look around.

1206
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:17,669
Palace Hotel.

1207
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:18,790
Got it!

1208
01:44:42,440 --> 01:44:44,874
Is there another exit?

1209
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:47,958
There's a back entrance for the staff.

1210
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:50,151
Wait for us there in five minutes.

1211
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:51,355
Sure!

1212
01:44:57,400 --> 01:45:02,599
Why are we being followed everywhere?

1213
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:03,749
I'm sorry, sir.

1214
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:05,838
The first floor is full,

1215
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:07,235
is the second floor alright?

1216
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:09,515
Alright!

1217
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:24,590
Jump!

1218
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:41,875
Stupid idiots...

1219
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:47,716
Go look for them!

1220
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:50,189
Find them in three days or else!

1221
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:53,511
Sir, my brother is with the Green Gang

1222
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:56,559
finding someone in Shanghai is a piece of cake.

1223
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:03,312
The Peking caucus has 1 3 members,

1224
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:06,518
including Li Ta-chao, Chang Kuo-t'ao,

1225
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:08,597
Lo Zhang-lung, Liu Jen-ch'ing,

1226
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:11,439
Ch'en Te-jung, Teng Chung-hsia,

1227
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:15,633
Kao Chun-yu, Miu Po-ying, Ho Meng-hsiung,

1228
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:18,439
Chu Wu-shan, Fan Hung-chieh, Wu Ju-ming.

1229
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:21,119
Heads up, everyone!

1230
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:24,155
A draft platform of the CCP

1231
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:27,517
is hereby pronounced
for delegates to comment and discuss.

1232
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:31,154
Proletariat must join force
with the revolutionary army

1233
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:33,635
and overthrow the bourgeois regime;

1234
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:35,632
they must help the working class

1235
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:38,439
until the class system is abolished,

1236
01:46:38,640 --> 01:46:40,676
and until the class struggle has ended.

1237
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:44,316
Meaning, when class system is finally abolished,

1238
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:46,238
a proletariat dictatorship will be established.

1239
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:48,359
Liaise with the Comintern,

1240
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:50,232
and adopt the Soviet model.

1241
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:53,233
Unite workers, peasants and soldiers

1242
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:56,995
and adopt social revolution as our goal.

1243
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:59,556
Those who accept the Party's platform and policies,

1244
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:01,551
and willing to be loyal members,

1245
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:03,278
upon the introduction of a Party member,

1246
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:05,511
regardless of gender and nationality

1247
01:47:05,680 --> 01:47:07,272
can be admitted as Party members

1248
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:08,949
and become our comrades.

1249
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:11,078
But...

1250
01:47:11,800 --> 01:47:13,552
before their initiation into the Party,

1251
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:15,312
they must sever all ties

1252
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:17,238
with other parties and organisations

1253
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:18,799
whose platforms are contradictory to ours.

1254
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:20,673
Tomorrow is the last day of the congress,

1255
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,159
the main agenda

1256
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:25,073
is to adopt the platform
and election of the Central Committee.

1257
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:27,037
Comrades Maring and Nikolsky

1258
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:28,997
will attend tomorrow's closing session.

1259
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:37,116
Rickshaw!

1260
01:48:23,280 --> 01:48:27,034
Sorry, we had to make a detour.

1261
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:28,590
Is everyone here?

1262
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:31,117
Chou Fo-hai is in the toilet,

1263
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:32,110
he'll be right back.

1264
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:33,436
It's that Chou again!

1265
01:48:34,120 --> 01:48:34,916
Let's not wait.

1266
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:37,633
The draft platform we tabled yesterday,

1267
01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:40,230
can continue to be discussed now.

1268
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:41,590
I have a comment.

1269
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:44,157
Regarding nationality...

1270
01:48:56,360 --> 01:48:57,110
Can I help you?

1271
01:48:57,800 --> 01:48:58,596
Looking for someone?

1272
01:48:58,960 --> 01:48:59,676
What do you want?

1273
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:02,836
Who are you looking for?

1274
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,353
Chairman Wang of the Social League.

1275
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,399
There's no Social League

1276
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:07,510
or Chairman Wang.

1277
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:14,994
I'm sorry...

1278
01:49:25,440 --> 01:49:27,556
Maring calls for an immediate recess.

1279
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:30,513
I agree with Comrade Maring.

1280
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:31,835
Let's adjourne.

1281
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:50,509
This is my home. What are you doing here?

1282
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:56,788
Why do you organise meeting in your house?

1283
01:49:57,200 --> 01:50:01,113
What meeting? I was entertaining guests.

1284
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:04,636
That two are from which country?

1285
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:05,789
Which two?

1286
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:07,752
The two foreigners.

1287
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:09,990
They're Dutch.

1288
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:17,236
Pack up and be ready to move out!

1289
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:28,996
Sir.

1290
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:34,518
What do you do for a living?

1291
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:36,550
Professor.

1292
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:38,990
Him?

1293
01:50:39,720 --> 01:50:40,755
My colleague.

1294
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:46,037
Today I can close your house and catch your people.

1295
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:49,955
Because you are teaching in university,
I'll let you free.

1296
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:53,993
If not, you will burn yourself.

1297
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:56,115
I won't.

1298
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:11,116
How is it?

1299
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:13,269
It's fine.

1300
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:15,079
Comrade Maring said we must leave Shanghai.

1301
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:16,793
I suggest we go to Chiahsing

1302
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:19,235
rent a boat for the meeting.

1303
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:21,072
Is Maring coming?

1304
01:51:21,240 --> 01:51:22,309
He's too obvious a target,

1305
01:51:22,520 --> 01:51:24,192
for our safety, he's not going.

1306
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:25,156
Alright!

1307
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:26,271
What time do we leave?

1308
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:28,391
There's a train tomorrow at 1 0:00am.

1309
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:31,111
Does Ch'en Kung-po know?

1310
01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:32,429
I'll go get him tomorrow morning.

1311
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:41,559
Are you under surveillance?

1312
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:43,637
Probably not, it was an accident.

1313
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:45,115
Let's go home.

1314
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:46,989
The meeting is not yet over.

1315
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:51,596
To form a national party with just 50 people,

1316
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:53,079
this has to be a joke!

1317
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:00,869
A gun!

1318
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:11,631
Don't stare!

1319
01:54:34,640 --> 01:54:35,993
Homicide at Tatung Hotel!

1320
01:54:36,640 --> 01:54:37,595
Tatung Hotel?

1321
01:54:39,880 --> 01:54:41,233
That's where Ch'en Kung-po stays!

1322
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:48,634
Kung-po left for Kwangtung already.

1323
01:54:48,800 --> 01:54:50,279
Yesterday two people died at their hotel.

1324
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:52,431
His wife was petrified. So they left.

1325
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:54,759
It was a lovers' suicide pact!

1326
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:57,235
Cowards!

1327
01:54:59,000 --> 01:54:59,830
Let's go.

1328
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:25,357
Comrades, we have reached the critical hours.

1329
01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:26,993
The last item on the agenda,

1330
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:28,998
is to elect the Party Central Committee.

1331
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:30,675
Under democratic principles,

1332
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:32,075
we shall vote for

1333
01:55:32,240 --> 01:55:34,674
members of the Central Committee.

1334
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:45,793
We should have 1 3 delegates,

1335
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:47,234
but only 12 are in attendance.

1336
01:55:48,360 --> 01:55:49,190
After the vote,

1337
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:53,274
Ch'en Tu-hsiu, Chang Kuo-t'ao and Li Ta

1338
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:55,271
are elected Central Committee members,

1339
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:58,398
Ch'en Tu-hsiu is named General Secretary.

1340
01:55:58,880 --> 01:55:59,869
Meeting is concluded.

1341
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:01,630
Comrades,

1342
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:04,395
I'd like to recite from "The Communist Manifesto"

1343
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:06,352
to illustrate my thrill and excitement.

1344
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:12,191
The Communists disdain to conceal

1345
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:14,828
their aims and views.

1346
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:16,679
They openly declare

1347
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:19,600
that their ends can be attained

1348
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:21,990
only by the forcible overthrow

1349
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:22,637
of all existing social conditions.

1350
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:24,199
Let the ruling classes tremble

1351
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:26,510
at a communist revolution.

1352
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:30,316
The proletarians have nothing to lose
but their chains.

1353
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:33,439
They have a world to win.

1354
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:36,354
Proletarians of all countries, unite.

1355
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:39,838
Proletarians of all countries, unite.

1356
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,753
Proletarians of all countries, unite...

1357
01:56:43,120 --> 01:56:46,078
Proletarians of all countries...

1358
01:56:46,280 --> 01:56:47,315
...unite
